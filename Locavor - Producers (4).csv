Founded and operated by Anna-Kristin and Shawn, first-generation farmers with roots in Germany and Michigan respectively, the farm began from a simple yet profound desire: to reconnect with food, steward the land with intention, and offer their children a future rooted in environmental harmony. What started as a garden quickly blossomed into a full-fledged farm that now supplies nutrient-dense, organically raised food to the surrounding community.</p><p id="""">Their philosophy is clear and unwavering—farm in sync with nature. Abiding Acres is proudly free of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Instead, the farm’s health comes from rich compost, careful crop rotation, integrated animal systems, and deeply thoughtful soil stewardship. Their chickens are moved strategically to restore soil, their cover crops protect and nourish the earth, and their pest management system attracts beneficial insects while respecting biodiversity. They’ve even started a local composting initiative at their roadside stand, helping neighbors reduce waste and regenerate the land.</p><p id="""">More than a place to buy fresh produce, Abiding Acres is a living expression of resilience, sustainability, and love. From vibrant heirloom tomatoes to fragrant herbs and colorful bouquets, everything grown here carries the imprint of care, community, and environmental responsibility. For Anna-Kristin and Shawn, the goal is simple: to feed people honestly and leave the land better than they found it. Their vision is abiding—and it’s growing with each season.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee1b513f07e990ee421e_442440567_18006726590526730_4854224636210723369_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee1cf1658406a650c8b3_469668397_18030974081526730_8993589527774934085_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee1b46c7d0cc2c034aee_473292591_632173746031715_5902780487829482248_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee1b18f4d00cdb283cc1_456580945_18018395879526730_4996826345219728480_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee1cae756ee9cd73f33b_481279076_669642488951507_3137538787209598540_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee1bdccd358443aeba51_456580867_18018395897526730_7340557057867190019_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee1bdccd358443aeba55_452608670_18015226802526730_6549991664545104598_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683dee150435a81a3697a7c0_469577648_18030955736526730_630848567854589688_n.jpg,abidingacresct@gmail.com,248-842-2272,"107 East Street S, Suffield, CT 06078",https://www.abidingacresct.com/,Farm stand open April - October,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Melons</li><li>Mulberries</li><li>Pears</li><li>Raspberries</li><li>Strawberries</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Arugula</li><li>Asparagus</li><li>Beans</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Brussels Sprouts</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Celery</li><li>Cucumbers</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Ginger Root</li><li>Hot Peppers</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Kale</li><li>Kohlrabi</li><li>Peas</li><li>Radish</li><li>Rhubarb</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Summer Squash</li><li>Sweet Peppers</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Winter Squash</li><li>Other Vegetables (unspecified)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Basil</li><li>Cilantro</li><li>Dill</li><li>Mint</li><li>Parsley</li><li>Sage</li><li>Rosemary</li><li>Thyme</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Eggs</li><li>Maple Syrup</li><li>Fresh Bouquets</li></ul>",

The farm is home to a herd of 180 to 200 Black Angus cattle and commits itself exclusively to the production of 100% grass-fed and grass-finished beef. Each animal is born on the farm, nourished by mother’s milk, and raised on nutrient-rich pastures without hormones, prophylactic antibiotics, or grain. The farm’s rigorous rotational grazing practices and winter feed program reflect a deep respect for natural cycles and soil health.</p><p id="""">Steeped in responsible land stewardship, Aquidneck Farms proudly manages its entire operation in harmony with the environment. Fertilization relies solely on nutrient-dense manure, chicken droppings, and farm-made compost. The farm’s management practices hold certifications from the Natural Resource Conservation Services (NRCS) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), along with a Retail Food Peddlers license through the Rhode Island Health Department. Their meat is butchered and processed under USDA standards in nearby southern Massachusetts, ensuring both quality and traceability from pasture to plate.</p><p id="""">In addition to premium beef, Aquidneck Farms raises pastured poultry in movable outdoor coops called “chicken tractors,” which are methodically relocated daily over fresh pastureland.

In 1999, George Malkemus and Anthony Yurgaitis, renowned in the fashion world, purchased the historic Arethusa Farm to protect the land from development. Originally established in 1868 by the Webster family, the land had long since fallen into neglect. What began as an act of stewardship soon blossomed into a full-fledged agricultural renaissance, reawakening its dairy roots with just five cows and a vision of uncompromising excellence.</p><p id="""">Today, Arethusa is home to more than 300 cows and operates a state-of-the-art dairy plant where every product—from their old-fashioned chocolate milk to their award-winning cheeses—is crafted with meticulous care. Using vat pasteurization and small-batch techniques, they preserve the natural richness of their milk, producing butter, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream that harken back to a purer time. Their butter, for instance, is cultured over two days before churning, creating an unmatched depth of flavor. Each dairy product begins with milk from their own herd and is finished with artisanal precision.</p><p id="""">But Arethusa is more than just a dairy. The brand has expanded into culinary excellence with <em id="""">Arethusa al Tavolo</em>, an award-winning farm-to-table restaurant, and <em id="""">Arethusa a Mano</em>, a bakery and café offering elegant pastries and specialty coffee. With retail stores in Bantam, New Haven, and West Hartford, Arethusa shares its values of sustainability, taste, and tradition with communities across the state. Every element of their enterprise, from the barns to the butter, reflects a deep love for the land, a respect for the animal, and a celebration of food done right.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68659458937d76808923e565_Arethusa-Farm-Castellani.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68659458de2137eb460ec981_DSC04439-sqed.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865945963a8a157f2b42406_DSC06154.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68659458e2c18f5271233439_Aerial%2BFarm%2BSunset-sqed.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865945828c6ec729bd71475_Arethusa-1-1200x560.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68659452e45466643847f53f_IMG_0170-2-sqed.jpg,office@arethusafarmdairy.com,"Bantam 860-361-6460, New Haven (203) - 390 - 5114","Bantam Retail: 822 Bantam Rd.

From heirloom varieties like Northern Spy and Winesap to newer favorites like Honeycrisp and Zestar, their fruit is prized for its tree-ripened flavor and exceptional quality. The farm practices Integrated Pest Management (IPM), balancing organic and conventional methods to ensure both sustainability and safety.</p><p id="""">But Beardsley’s is more than an orchard—it is a place where tradition and innovation coexist. Whether savoring a warm cider donut, taking home a farm-fresh pie, or sipping small-batch hard cider crafted from heirloom apples, visitors experience the legacy of a family deeply connected to the land. With a farm store that hums from August through December and a distillery that adds spirited depth to the offerings, Beardsley’s remains a treasured part of Connecticut’s agricultural fabric and a beacon for seasonal joy.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876bb1d693c627171edd18f_young-girl-orchard.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876bb1d2a0632950579caf5_384974FA-F465-4FD9-9238-D8609BA21FE3_1_105_c.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876bb1dd1a7cc6580263efe_E1249EE6-0F0E-4F73-9F8D-D1168B9C3C2D_1_105_c.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876bb1d69e28c11bd6e7e58_peaches-in-ATV.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876bb1d0af6ca7c638b8ee1_488935000_1074514944716248_1650985429114723407_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876bb1d8f68aa0bd0c6f377_487411095_1070325265135216_3123745649982877448_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876bb184a290dc16a2f94fd_CIDER-BANNER-1.jpg,beardsleyscidermill1@gmail.com,(203) 926-1098,"278 Leavenworth Road, Shelton, CT 06484",https://beardsleyscidermill.com/,"Open daily 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM, August to Christmas, closed rest of year","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (25+ varieties including Honeycrisp, Zestar, McIntosh, Macoun, Empire, Cortland, Mutsu, Gala, Braeburn, Granny Smith, Northern Spy, Winesap, and more)</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Plums</li><li>Nectarines</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Baked Goods</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh Baked Pies (Apple, Apple Crumb, Peach, Pumpkin, Pecan, Fruit-n-Berries, Blueberry, Strawberry-Rhubarb, Sugar-Free Apple, Chocolate Cream, Coconut Cream)</li><li>Pumpkin Cheesecake (frozen)</li><li>Cider Donuts</li><li>Gluten-Free Cookies (Chocolate Chunk, Snickerdoodle)</li><li>Fruit Breads (Blueberry, Zucchini Walnut, Peach Raspberry, Apple-Caramel, Pumpkin, Orange-Cranberry-Nut)</li><li>Scones (Apple Cinnamon, Blueberry, Raspberry White Chocolate, seasonal)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Cider &amp; Beverages</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh Apple Cider (100% pure juice, unpasteurized and untreated cider available for hard cider making)</li><li>Hard Cider (special hard cider apple blend available seasonally)</li><li>Spirits (Produced under White Hills Distillery, sold in the farm store)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other Items</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Local Raw Honey (1lb, 2lb, 5lb jars)</li><li>Jams, Jellies, Salad Dressings, and Sauces</li></ul>",

Established in 1910 by the Preli family, the orchard has grown from modest beginnings into one of Connecticut’s most beloved and expansive farm destinations. Today, the farm remains in the hands of the Preli family, operated by Donald Preli Jr. and Michael Preli alongside their extended family, who continue to build upon a legacy of dedication to the land and its fruits.</p><p id="""">The farm’s roots trace back to 1904, when Louis Preli immigrated from Northern Italy at age 14. He worked the land with his uncle before eventually purchasing seven acres of his own, where he raised a family and grew crops while also producing railroad ties. Over the decades, the Preli family steadily expanded the property, planting strawberries, peaches, and fruit trees atop Belltown Road. In the 1970s, they opened a retail market in one of Louis’s original buildings—a cherished structure still in use today.</p><p id="""">Visitors to Belltown Hill Orchards are welcomed into a vibrant hub of seasonal agriculture, offering pick-your-own fruit from mid-June through late October.

Founded in 1935 by Robert S. Josephy, the orchard began as a humble 50-acre plot blending dairy and vegetable farming with an emerging passion for apples. Over decades, Josephy expanded the land and planted thousands of apple trees, gradually transforming the farm into a beloved local destination. For many years, apples and cider were sold primarily wholesale or from a simple roadside stand — but that all changed in 1985, when Paul and Mary Patterson acquired the orchard and introduced the now-famous Pick Your Own experience.</p><p id="""">Under the Patterson family’s stewardship, Blue Jay blossomed into a seasonal hallmark of New England life. Their vision turned the orchard into a community gathering place where families return each fall for cider donuts, pies, pumpkins, and fresh apples plucked from over 8,000 trees. It became Fairfield County’s first pick-your-own apple orchard and, to this day, remains its largest — welcoming as many as 5,000 guests per weekend in peak season. Despite hardships like late-season frosts that wiped out entire crops in 1985 and again in 2004, the Patterson’s commitment never wavered. Paul Patterson’s recent passing was met with an outpouring of condolences, a testament to the deep roots he and Mary laid in the community.</p><p id="""">Today, Blue Jay Orchards spans more than 122 acres and continues to be a beacon of tradition, hospitality, and abundance. Generations of visitors — some who came as children, now returning with their grandchildren — find something timeless here: a place where the scent of warm cider fills the air, where the crisp snap of a fresh-picked apple signals the change of season, and where simple pleasures endure. The orchard, lovingly maintained and pruned each winter in anticipation of fall’s bounty, carries forward the spirit of its founders — from Josephy’s quiet vision to the Pattersons’ heartfelt legacy.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3a7a6d434e5812c84a_fall-apple-fruit-903215.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3b02a17a0eaedf33fc_apple-tree-apples-light-4208594.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3b95c647d9b3da38d6_resized-apple-orchards1.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3a7ab0806e2e59fb6d_blue-jay.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3af3f17c152af64410_DSC_0063-Version-2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3a9b2daa8d8287e40d_DSC_0070.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3ad732e43e3eb66254_DSC_0094.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3af3f17c152af6442a_DSC_0369-med.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3a357b12a5ecedc1cb_22406139_1846987045326043_2231892954352437853_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3a8e2260ed1a684fbe_DSC_0035.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876be3603f90978cddca8d6_DSC_0036.jpg,bluejayorchardsct@gmail.com,(203) 748-0119,"125 Plumtrees Road, Bethel, CT 06801",https://bluejayorchardsct.com/,"11am - 5pm, Labor Day through December","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Over 20 varieties of apples (Pick Your Own &amp; pre-picked)</li><li>Pumpkins (including jumbo, decorative, mini)</li><li>Gourds</li><li>Blackberries (used in bakery products)</li><li>Blueberries and raspberries (used in pies, not confirmed as fresh produce)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Baked Goods (Bakery)</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apple pies</li><li>Apple cider donuts</li><li>Fruit pies (including triple berry, blackberry-apple)</li><li>Pastries</li><li>Cookies</li><li>Dessert breads</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Beverages</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh pressed apple cider</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry Items (Farm Market)</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Local honey (produced by bees that pollinate the orchard)</li><li>Maple syrup</li><li>Maple sugar candy</li><li>Jams</li><li>Jellies</li><li>Fruit butters</li><li>Sauces</li></ul>",

Founded by first-generation farmers Nick Weinstock and Danielle Larese, BOTL is a bold expression of what farming can look like when driven by deep values and fierce curiosity. Set on 41 acres of transitional silvopasture, the farm raises heritage breed pigs, sheep, goats, and chickens — all rotationally grazed, pasture-raised, and certified to the highest welfare standards. Every aspect of the farm, from feed to fencing to the hum of the on-site bees, reflects a whole-systems approach designed to nurture animals, land, and community alike.</p><p id="""">Nick, the “Primary Farmer,” brings years of experience in construction management and sustainability to the daily rhythm of the farm. Danielle, a theoretical physicist turned USDA scientist, brings a rare analytical lens to animal husbandry and pasture management, even as she continues her full-time off-farm scientific work. Together, they form an unlikely but powerful team: the builder and the scientist, united by their love of food and their shared belief that the best-tasting meat comes from animals who are respected, cared for, and allowed to live as nature intended. Their decision to start farming was not a long-standing plan but a slow-burning commitment that emerged from values, mentors, and a healthy dose of risk.</p><p id="""">BOTL Farm is not just about raising livestock — it is about challenging the norms of industrial agriculture, one beautifully managed paddock at a time.

Founded in the summer of 2014 by Alby Brandon, the farm began as a humble project on leased land. By 2015, the focus turned exclusively to Certified Organic fruits and vegetables—a commitment that has guided the farm’s practices ever since. With steady, thoughtful expansion, Brandon Family Farm grew from just 3 acres to over 15 acres of production by 2019, a testament to both vision and tenacity.</p><p id="""">At the heart of the farm are Alby and Heather Brandon, who together steward the land with a deep respect for ecology and community. Their team of four, bolstered by seasonal help, cultivates over 40 varieties of fruits and vegetables using methods that honor soil health, biodiversity, and seasonal rhythms. Green manures, compost, mulches, and cover crops are foundational tools in their organic toolbox, reflecting their philosophy that “healthy soil grows healthy crops, and healthy crops grow healthy humans.” With the addition of eight greenhouses and 1.5 acres of blueberries on their Liberty Lane property, the farm has embraced passive solar growing to extend seasons naturally and sustainably.</p><p id="""">Brandon Family Farm is as much a community endeavor as it is an agricultural one. Through their beloved CSA program, pick-your-own strawberry fields, and the South Kingstown Farmers Market, Alby and Heather have created a space where fresh, local food is celebrated and accessible. Their plant sales—offering home gardeners organic starts grown from seed—further underscore their mission to spread real, nourishing food from the ground up. A farm store is on the horizon for 2025, signaling a new chapter in what continues to be a story of growth, generosity, and grounded stewardship.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bed8ea5ee8127ab589c518_2_1737553344.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bed8f65afe275ae40ae57a_IMG_3950_1643598703.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bed8feea76afc406a9ecfb_lavender_1737573220.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bed91bb9e2ecfba119cea3_pyo%205_1737569055.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bed9817f69090cebcbc82f_117257649_2593583377573347_1040509927148578967_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bed9275c7b828c591ee1eb_liberty%20crops_1737572589.jpg,brandonfamilyfarm@gmail.com,(401) 649‑1083,"262 Liberty Lane, West Kingston, RI 02892",https://www.brandonfamilyfarm.com/,"No set hours; CSA pickup Wed 3‑6 PM, otherwise by appointment","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Tomatoes</li><li id="""">Zucchini</li><li id="""">Squash</li><li id="""">Eggplant</li><li id="""">Tomatillos</li><li id="""">Sweet peppers</li><li id="""">Hot peppers</li><li id="""">Pole beans</li><li id="""">Bok choy</li><li id="""">Cucumbers</li><li id="""">Tatsoi</li><li id="""">Swiss chard</li><li id="""">Lettuce</li><li id="""">Garlic</li><li id="""">Onions</li><li id="""">Broccoli</li><li id="""">Cauliflower</li><li id="""">Pea shoots</li><li id="""">Sugar snap peas</li><li id="""">Salad turnips</li><li id="""">Sunflower shoots</li><li id="""">Spinach</li><li id="""">Sweet potatoes</li><li id="""">Winter squash</li><li id="""">Carrots</li><li id="""">Beets</li><li id="""">Radishes</li><li id="""">Turnips</li><li id="""">Sweet corn</li><li id="""">Honeynut squash</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Watermelon</li><li id="""">Strawberries</li><li id="""">Cantaloupe</li><li id="""">Raspberries</li><li id="""">Blackberries</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry/Other</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Certified Organic Vegetable and Fruit Plants for Sale (4-packs and 4"" pots)</li></ul>",

Located in the rolling hills of Cornwall Bridge, this dairy farm is the embodiment of a deep farming philosophy—one that prioritizes pasture, soil health, and the sacred relationship between mother and calf. At its core is a small family: Jeff, Sarah, and Hunter, whose years of experience in organic and pasture-based agriculture across New England culminated in the stewardship of this treasured land, once known as Stone Wall Dairy.</p><p id="""">The creamery’s name, “Calf &amp; Clover,” poetically captures the farm’s two central values: the legacy and future carried by each newborn calf, and the life-giving clover that fills their hillside pastures. Their cows graze rotationally on fresh fields twice daily during the growing season, and live with freedom and dignity, cared for under the “Madre method”—a practice that allows calves to be raised by their mothers or nurse cows. This approach produces not only healthier animals but also some of the most nutrient-dense and flavorful milk in the region, rich in omega-3s and CLA.</p><p id="""">With an inviting year-round, self-serve farm store, Calf &amp; Clover offers raw milk, yogurt, ricotta, dairy beef, eggs, and a curated selection of local goods.

Purchased in 2010 by Allen and Becky Clark along with their son Zach, the orchard in Granby builds upon a legacy first planted by Hal and Nora Law in 1976. The Law family began with a vision and a few apple trees, welcoming the public for U-Pick experiences by 1980. The Clarks have since breathed new life into this historic land, rehabilitating the Apple Store and Creamery and transforming the site into a thriving multi-faceted farm destination.</p><p id="""">Today, Clark Farms is much more than an orchard. With a cidery, a café, a bustling event calendar, and the Clark Farms Greenhouse in Suffield, the Clarks have cultivated a vibrant, seasonal community hub. Their farming philosophy is deeply rooted in sustainability, utilizing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices to grow fruit, vegetables, herbs, and plants in harmony with nature. Their orchard now features over 15,000 dwarf apple and peach trees grown on trellises, increasing both flavor and nutrition, while their greenhouse bursts with color each spring and fall, offering thousands of blooms and vegetable starts for home and commercial growers alike.</p><p id="""">But what truly sets Clark Farms apart is its unmistakable warmth and authenticity. The café feels like home—with unmatched views of the orchard, simple comfort food, and a community spirit that encourages guests to slow down and savor. From cider slushies to trivia nights, apple picking to hosting weddings under the tented sky, the Clarks have created a place where the land, the food, and the people are beautifully intertwined. This is not just a farm—it is a living expression of family, tradition, and a deep love for growing.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68655e594e757dcc66946f53_458452928_18284435062228279_6660494661931631647_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68655e5ae7b2e498ddff0631_489026153_1307697764331147_8655244592219398720_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68655e599e73d74febba1e40_clark-farms-field-trip-1.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68655e593eba1abf2b8073cb_unnamed.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68655e59df5c0c4226e4b8a0_unnamed%20(1).webp,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68655e563c49545b59f81f97_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-20%2Bat%2B10.56.13%2BAM.jpg,info@clarkfarmsct.com,(860) 653-4022,"29 Bushy Hill Road, Granby, CT 06035",https://clarkfarmsct.com/,"Farm & Café: Saturday & Sunday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM, Breakfast: 8:00 AM – 12:00 PM, Lunch: 12:15 PM – 4:30 PM","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (20+ varieties, dwarf trees)</li><li>Peaches (grown on custom 3-wire trellises)</li><li>Asian Pears</li><li>Nectarines</li><li>Plums</li><li>Blueberries (fresh and frozen)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Seasonal staples (not specified; grown for café and farm stand)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Variety of culinary herbs from the greenhouse (sold as starts and container plants)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers &amp; Plants:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Hanging baskets (3,000+)</li><li>Patio planters (600+)</li><li>Geraniums (4,000)</li><li>Mums (10,000+)</li><li>Annuals, perennials, container plants</li><li>Vegetable starts</li><li>Flower varieties include: Petunias, Million Bells, Geraniums, Scaevola, Torenia, Cuphea, Verbena, Begonias, Portulaca, Bidens, Lobelia, Alyssum, Euphorbia, Impatiens, Osteospermums, Dahlias</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Beverages:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Farm-made Sweet Apple Cider</li><li id="""">Hard Cider:<ul id=""""><li>B.N.D (dry)</li><li>Ruddy Wild (cranberry)</li><li>Jump Start (ginger)</li><li>Bear Essentials (honey blend)</li></ul></li><li id="""">Apple Wines:<ul id=""""><li>Citron</li><li>Apple Blossom</li></ul></li><li>Local CT Craft Beer</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Prepared Foods (from the Café):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Farm-to-table breakfasts and lunches</li><li>Apple cider donuts</li><li>Ice cream</li><li>Pub food (sandwiches, skillet meals, waffles, French toast, smoothies)</li></ul>",

With over 50 acres under cultivation, Clatter Valley Farm grows a generous variety of fruits and vegetables using traditional and sustainable methods, including manual cultivation and composted manure. Their reach extends beyond their CSA and farm stand, supplying fresh produce to restaurants across Litchfield and Fairfield counties.</p><p id="""">The Schulz family’s dedication to local agriculture goes well beyond their own fields. Jeremy, a certified crop advisor and founding member of the New Milford Farmland Preservation Committee, has actively advocated for small farms at both local and national levels. Willow, passionate about food access, has forged meaningful partnerships with City Center Danbury, the United Way, and local food banks to bring produce to seniors and vulnerable families in need. Together, they orchestrate the rhythms of the farm—from planting to harvest, from animal care to CSA logistics—while raising their three children with the same hands-on, heartfelt commitment to land and community.</p><p id="""">Each member of their ""#farmily"" plays a unique role: Olivia, a budding agriculturalist and volunteer firefighter; Aidan, the farm’s resident apiarist and mechanic; Anna, a swift and spirited young planter; and “Grandaddy” Tom, who helps with everything from fieldwork to tomato quality control.

The business was formally founded in 1994 by Norman Bloom, though its roots trace back to the 1940s when his father, Norm Sr., and uncle Hillard began reviving Connecticut’s shellfish industry after its collapse in the mid-20th century. Today, with a fleet of 15 boats and thousands of acres of natural oyster beds, Copps Island continues to supply restaurants and consumers across the country with some of the freshest, most sustainably farmed oysters available.</p><p id="""">Norman Bloom &amp; Son is known for operating one of the last traditional, wild-harvest oyster farms in the United States. Their shellfish are cultivated using age-old seafloor farming techniques across the Norwalk and Westport Island chain—where sandy bottoms and nutrient-rich, fast-moving tides create ideal conditions for plump, sweet oysters with a signature briny bite. The company harvests daily, ensuring unmatched freshness and quality. Their product line also includes clams and lobsters, all available year-round, along with a retail line of shucking tools, cookbooks, and skincare products made from their own sugar kelp farm.</p><p id="""">Sustainability is at the heart of everything they do. From rigorous water testing and environmental partnerships to their kelp cultivation and local conservation efforts, Copps Island Oysters embodies a full-circle commitment to both ocean health and community. What began as a single boat and a few oyster grounds has blossomed into a legacy carried forward by Norm’s children, Jimmy and Jeanne, who are preserving the tradition while embracing innovation. Whether you're visiting their retail shop in Norwalk, enjoying a catered raw bar at your next event, or simply savoring their oysters at home, you're experiencing a living heritage—one that's been shaped by the tides, the land, and generations of hands that still work them.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876c3cbdfe7490eb17e2730_Mask%2BGroup-5.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876c3cfc833bc55189ae1b2_Mask%2BGroup-1.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876c3cb42a7b373efdf0218_Group%2B436.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876c3c8c0456a1a7ab309e3_2021-03-10.webp,info@coppsislandoysters.com,(203) 866-7546,"7 Edgewater Place, Norwalk, CT 06855",https://coppsislandoysters.com/,Retail Hours (Norwalk): Wednesday: 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM Friday & Saturday: 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM Closed Thursday,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Shellfish</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Oysters (all year round):</strong><ul id=""""><li><em id="""">Copps Island Oysters</em> – ~3.5 in, sweet &amp; slightly briny, thick shell</li><li><em id="""">White Rock Oysters</em> – ~3 in, salty-sweet, uniform and deep-cupped</li><li><em id="""">Mystics</em> – ~3.5 in, balance of brine/sweetness/mineral, green-hued shells</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Clams (all year round):</strong><ul id=""""><li>Little Neck (2 in)</li><li>Top Neck (2.5 in)</li><li>Cherry Stone (3.5 in)</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Lobster:</strong><ul id=""""><li>Long Island Sound &amp; Maine-sourced (1¼ – 1½ lb)</li></ul></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Value-Added Products</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Shucking Kits</li><li>Cookbooks</li><li>Skincare products made from sugar kelp</li><li>Catering services (raw bars, clam bakes, lobster rolls, etc.)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other Seafood Experiences</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Food Truck: “Copps Island Oyster Shack”</li><li>Catering with “Shuck Truck” (oysters, clams, shrimp, more)</li></ul>",

Its story begins in the early 1900s when Lucaz and Celia Dunai, Polish immigrants, first acquired the land. With a deep love for the soil of the Connecticut River Valley, Lucaz expanded the dairy farm into a thriving operation that also grew premium tobacco. This love for the land was passed on through generations, shaping the farm into a cornerstone of the local agricultural community.</p><p id="""">After the dairy operation ceased in the late 1970s due to declining milk prices, Lucaz’s daughters, Donna and Kathy, stepped in to preserve the family legacy. They began modestly—converting an old garage into a market stand—and over the decades, their vision and dedication transformed the farm into a multifaceted enterprise. In 2007, aided by a state farm reinvestment grant, they built a commercial kitchen and retail store. By 2009, the family launched a CSA to expand community access to their homegrown produce and artisan goods.</p><p id="""">Today, Kathy Dunai and her daughters Amanda and Ashley carry the torch with pride. Cupola Hollow Farm offers an array of handcrafted, small-batch products—from jams and pickles to baked goods and soaps—all made with care and tradition. The farm remains an active participant in regional farmers markets and community events, and its doors are always open to those seeking a taste of Connecticut’s agricultural heritage. With its rolling 59 acres and enduring spirit, Cupola Hollow is more than a farm—it’s a living legacy.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865606ebe540718e4973f0b_476440389_1049493876984958_4260259637258602122_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865606ebd900da6522857dc_476438126_1049084737025872_635950775189593154_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865606e3702793598fa1ab7_476750616_1049084867025859_6002210364648328200_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865606b2624a9f298d32a69_476198149_1049084830359196_4709927346919391800_n.jpg,cupolahollowfarm@aol.com,(860) 668-0859,"1510 North Stone Street, West Suffield, CT 06093",http://www.cupolahollowfarms.com/,Open 10-4 Saturday and Sunday,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Seasonal vegetables</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Fresh fruits</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry Goods &amp; Preserves:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Hot Pepper Jelly (Kathy’s trademark)</li><li id="""">Nana’s Pickles</li><li id="""">Jams</li><li id="""">Jellies</li><li id="""">Pickles</li><li id="""">Relish</li><li id="""">Salsa</li><li id="""">BBQ Rubs</li><li id="""">Dried Dip Mixes</li><li id="""">Honey (from farm apiaries)</li><li id="""">Maple Syrup</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Baked Goods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Home-baked pies</li><li id="""">Breads</li><li id="""">Muffins</li><li id="""">Cookies</li><li id="""">Fudge</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Body Care:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Goat’s milk soap</li><li id="""">Candles</li></ul>",

Originally immigrants from Italy, the Donderos settled in Connecticut and cultivated a homestead centered on cows, raspberries, apples, and grapes. Their youngest son Edward—affectionately known as Rugged—and his wife Doris continued the tradition, raising apples with their son Eddie and his wife Judy. It was under their care that the beloved “pick your own” experience began, bringing community members closer to their food and to the family behind it.</p><p id="""">Today, the farm is operated by Joe and Sandy Dondero, along with their children Joey Jr., Nicholas, Anthony, and Angelina, marking four generations of continuous stewardship. The family has grown the operation into a vibrant, multi-faceted farm business, including farmers markets across the state, a thriving CSA program, a bakery known for award-winning pies and preserves, and a sprawling 7,200 square foot greenhouse. In 2011, Dondero Orchards expanded with the acquisition of Mountain View Farm on Hebron Avenue—land farmed by the Malnati/Sestero family since the 1800s—further deepening their roots in the region.</p><p id="""">At its heart, Dondero Orchards is about community and connection—between the land, the growers, and those who gather to enjoy the fruits of their labor. From farm dinners under the open sky to handmade holiday pies, Dondero delivers quality, tradition, and a warm welcome to all. Whether you're savoring sun-ripened berries, wandering through rows of heritage apples, or enjoying a bite from their orchard café, each visit is a reminder of the farm’s timeless mission: to nourish, delight, and bring people together.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685065717a88c7c90a469918_image-asset%20(4).jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506570cdc5ec62db68b387_image-asset.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506570b84ed36ed67b9ffd_500823496_18272422165285184_7176217980329891324_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506570db57353ddb9fcdb8_502616184_18272668444285184_5333263875794731115_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850657085d0ff4ca312baa8_503511556_18273013891285184_417207053781033252_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506570eaef98e848365c88_491422258_18268026592285184_6818084957440302980_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685065718eeeb917a1001dcc_495044674_18269435059285184_25220599145171482_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685065705af5f3f0e4183df2_497765654_18271155328285184_7834744574827179376_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506570bcf9ee6fe8d898fa_image-asset%20(1).jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506571063afd32c2c39d74_image-asset%20(2).jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506571835c99cc5c49098a_image-asset%20(3).jpeg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850656593f17b818dfa2518_processed_RemoteMediaFile_6553759_0_2022_07_20_19_23_3629.jpg,donderoorchards@cox.net,(860) 659-0294,"529 Woodland Street, South Glastonbury, CT 06073, 3582 Hebron Avenue, Glastonbury, CT 06033",https://www.donderoorchards.com/,"Main Location (March–December): Wednesday–Monday, 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM Secondary Location (May–August): Wednesday–Sunday, 8:00 AM – 3:00 PM Hours are seasonal.

Draghi &amp; Sons, LLC is a family-run farm that has grown into one of the most beloved agricultural institutions in South Glastonbury, Connecticut. Its story began when Angelo Draghi, an Italian immigrant who arrived in New York with just $15, purchased a rocky farm nestled in the hills of Foote Road. With determination and the help of his sons and a loyal draft horse, Angelo transformed the rugged terrain into fruitful orchards, laying the groundwork for generations of farming excellence.</p><p id="""">The farm passed through generations, adapting and expanding with the times. In 1968, Angelo’s sons Gino and Andrew acquired the farmstand on Main Street, and in 1980, Gino’s son Darrell joined the business—marking the rise of its third generation. With a passion for horticulture, Darrell introduced greenhouses and launched a robust flower-growing operation, eventually establishing six greenhouses including a state-of-the-art sales house. The bakery was later added, and quickly became known for its wide array of scratch-made pies, breads, cookies, quiches, and more.</p><p id="""">Today, E. Draghi &amp; Sons continues under Darrell’s stewardship, with the loyal support of his mother Sandra, sister Cheryl, and a dedicated team.

Whether stopping by for a pie or picking up Christmas greenery, customers are welcomed like family into this enduring legacy of local agriculture.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686562923b1986a4cb11b195_IMG_0555_edited.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656292b65cfbb9e4314235_image23.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865629227622bc7cab2be21_My%20project-1%20(5).avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656292c38149d3b26875a4_image19%20(1).avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686562928d4fc20865c8db6f_unnamed.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656292a50c309e8c96f66b_489027018_1245296197043973_5360576545471305050_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656292a8d69c45d7f0d7b0_unnamed%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656292f0427d9b09c94383_image35%20(1).avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686562929d98e84e5ec048bb_506607021_1304306051142987_6696319156626761661_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656285d38a57768c75f111_unnamed%20(2).webp,draghis@att.net,(860) 633-2197,"80 Main Street (Route 17), South Glastonbury, CT 06073",https://www.draghifarms.com/,"Open daily from 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM (until November 1), After November 1: 7:00 AM – 5:00 PM, Open seasonally from late April until December 24","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (multiple varieties)</li><li>Pears</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Pumpkins</li><li>Gourds</li><li>Other native fruits (seasonal)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Tomatoes (regular, Roma Plum, San Marzano)</li><li>Sweet Corn</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Squash</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Kale</li><li>Cucumbers (including pickling)</li><li>Basil</li><li>Other seasonal native vegetables</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Organic culinary herbs (sold as starts and potted plants)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Dairy &amp; Protein:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Local farm-fresh eggs</li><li>Local dairy products</li><li>Vermont Cabot cheeses</li><li>Summer sausages</li><li>Smoked meats</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry Goods &amp; Preserves:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Pickled vegetables</li><li>Salsas</li><li>Jams &amp; Jellies</li><li>No-sugar preserves</li><li>Fruit &amp; butter spreads</li><li>Spices</li><li>Sauces</li><li>Salad dressings</li><li>Dessert toppings</li><li>Stonewall Kitchen products</li><li>Terrapin Ridge Farms items</li><li>Honey (local)</li><li>Maple syrup (Connecticut and Vermont)</li><li>Old-fashioned candies</li><li>Maple candies</li><li>Pancake mixes</li><li>Nuts and dried fruit</li><li>Homemade biscotti</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Baked Goods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Muffins</li><li>Donuts</li><li>Croissants</li><li>Pastries</li><li>Fruit pies (regular and no-sugar-added)</li><li>Cream pies</li><li>Cheesecakes</li><li>Coffee cakes</li><li>Layer cakes</li><li>Cookies &amp; whoopie pies</li><li>Brownies &amp; squares</li><li>Sweet &amp; savory breads</li><li>Quiches</li><li>Flatbreads</li><li>Garlic knots</li><li>Focaccia</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Frozen Prepared Foods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fruit and cream pies</li><li>Quiches</li><li>Cakes and cheesecakes</li><li>Flatbreads</li><li>Soups</li><li>Savory breads</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers &amp; Plants (from Greenhouses):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Hanging baskets and patio planters</li><li>Bedding plants (flowers, vegetables, herbs)</li><li>Organic vegetable and herb starts</li><li>Geraniums</li><li>Proven Winner plants</li><li>Hydrangeas, rose bushes</li><li>Perennials</li><li>Tropical plants (hibiscus, mandevilla)</li><li>Succulents</li><li>Houseplants</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Seasonal &amp; Holiday Items:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fall decorations: mums, kale, cabbage, corn stalks, hay bales</li><li>Christmas décor: Connecticut-grown Fraser fir trees (3–10 ft), wreaths, garlands, swags, arrangements, poinsettias</li><li>Custom planters and holiday arrangements</li><li>Gift boxes and baskets (apples, pears, cheeses, jams, etc.)</li></ul>",

Haley, a Rhode Island native and Yale-trained designer with roots in traditional Swedish woodworking and culinary arts, met Andy—a blacksmith, writer, and former ranch wrangler—in Colorado. Together, they pursued a land-based lifestyle, hunting, growing, and preserving their own food before returning to Connecticut to take over the farm in 2011. Since then, they’ve grown the farm into one of the largest producers of chemical-free cut flowers in the state, and their produce continues to be a seasonal favorite at their roadside farm stand.</p><p id="""">Eddy Farm’s growing philosophy is rooted in health and sustainability. Though not certified organic, they grow everything without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides, instead prioritizing soil mineral balance as a natural defense. This careful stewardship ensures not only the long-term vitality of the land but also the highest-quality, most flavorful produce and flowers. From peak-ripeness tomatoes to stunning heirloom mums, the farm’s bounty is a reflection of its values: beauty, resilience, and an unshakable commitment to integrity.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676da2ad05a82bc3adb9_IMG_3906.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d21e116cdeea3f204_IMG_5570.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d9ba5adf4fbeffb1c_IMG_5211.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d3bf3afb6214eb4b6_IMG_5264.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676de523ddb6243c7278_IMG_5345.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676de58212818170b601_IMG_5549.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d373582a6bffbb752_IMG_8432.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d5203d46eada154c1_IMG_6717.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676c1e3fb4197982cd7b_IMG_6770.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d53c020e4f3c9715c_IMG_9752.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676c55af34185c4d2f2b_IMG_3472.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676dc024e4491c278e8d_IMG_1432.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d054b440fcfc260f8_IMG_4708.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676c21e116cdeea3f1b8_IMG_4713.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850676d9efefca8585b9c60_IMG_1651%2Bcopy.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6850675e7ac604037fa1b30a_AU6A2081.jpg,eddyfarmct@gmail.com,,"851 Willard Avenue, Newington, CT 06111",https://www.eddyfarmct.com/,"July 1 – mid-October, 7 days a week Monday to Friday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM Saturday & Sunday: 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM Closed for the season outside of these months.","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Sweet Corn (including Silver Queen)</li><li>Cucumbers (pickling and salad)</li><li>Summer Squash</li><li>Basil, Parsley, Sage, Lavender, Cilantro</li><li>Radishes</li><li>Beets</li><li>Kale</li><li>Swiss Chard</li><li>Baby Potatoes</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Red and Heirloom Tomatoes</li><li>Eggplant</li><li>Sweet and Hot Peppers</li><li>Green Beans</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Pumpkins</li><li>Turnips</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Brussels Sprouts</li><li>Winter Squash</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Berries (varieties unspecified)</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Nectarines</li><li>Summer Apples</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Fall Apples (many varieties, unspecified)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers (Cut):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Ranunculus</li><li>Anemones</li><li>Specialty Lisianthus</li><li>Heirloom Mums</li><li>Dahlias</li><li>40+ annual varieties</li><li>Perennials, woodies, and cool season crops<br>(<em id="""">Sold wholesale via CT Flower Collective and at the farm stand</em>)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Bakery:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh baked bread from Hartford Baking Company (sold daily at farm stand)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Flower shares</li><li>Specialty bouquet shares</li><li>Wholesale cut flowers via CT Flower Collective</li></ul>",

Established in 1979 by Bob and Cathee Alex, the farm began as a vision rooted in childhood memories and a passion for the land. The original 27-acre parcel—once an untended mix of cornfield and wetlands—was lovingly transformed over decades into a biologically managed haven for fruit, flowers, and pollinators.</p><p id="""">The farm initially blossomed as a thriving blueberry operation, with over 7,000 bushes meticulously planted and nurtured through the 1980s and beyond. But Evergreen’s evolution is also a story of adaptability. When conventional farming methods proved unsustainable, Bob made the courageous shift in 2012 to fully organic and biological practices—eschewing synthetic inputs in favor of compost tea, fish hydrosylate, hand-weeding, and soil revitalization techniques. This transition renewed not only the health of the land but the farm's spirit. Over the years, Evergreen expanded to include blackberries, elderberries, and raspberries, and ultimately restructured as an LLC with an eye toward multi-generational succession.</p><p id="""">Today, as weather patterns shift and crops face new challenges, Evergreen has entered its next chapter. In 2024, after 45 years of blueberry cultivation, Bob and Cathee retired the berries that once defined the farm. In their place, a sweeping wildflower meadow now flourishes, serving as a sanctuary for native bees, butterflies, and birds. Black raspberries remain the farm's seasonal treasure, grown in deeper, more resilient soils. With each visitor who picks a berry or a bouquet, the legacy of love, resilience, and stewardship continues. Evergreen Berry Farm stands not just as a place of harvest, but as a living narrative of how to care for the earth—and one another.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60bf07ab46e67dcf15b_444900754_883819003775532_7228515701715379850_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60beb4540a7a4b4ad56_515493745_1184114083746021_5266958001967316890_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60b17d329bcec3c7f8c_495271879_1132903738867056_761277248321617331_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60b68b252c23abf4d64_486687293_1102351558588941_7792745321057325331_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60a65f4c65342bb447a_481898489_1086446300179467_5845280594854397076_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60a008505e29b582700_489104551_24116740401259778_7612558404879491390_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60b611e759fd8060c13_469138815_9625235970836795_4890745424336669531_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60a2fe467b5685c01c2_115948176_3757396327620818_6923732602582632192_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60aca58d74eda78a76e_109583896_3726686787358439_2628366908516687851_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60a405fd774eb34e9ec_68536352_2911874005506392_3294717451970805760_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa60a90084515c3ea0c23_38509705_2292447500782382_6327457511091732480_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686aa6069b81110ca562e381_481997057_1086146496876114_8642958184616909831_n.jpg,evergreenberryfarm@gmail.com,860-274-0825,"435 Bassett Road, Watertown, CT 06795",https://www.evergreenberryfarm.com/home.html,Black Raspberry Season (Early–Mid July): 8:00 AM – 12:00 PM daily while berries last Post-Berry Season: Occasional pop-up wildflower bouquet days; check social media for dates,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Black Raspberries (PYO only; variety: Jewel)</li><li><em id="""">Note: Blueberries, blackberries, elderberries, and golden raspberries previously grown, but no longer cultivated as of 2024</em></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Beverages &amp; Frozen Goods</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh seltzers and iced teas made from farm-grown berries, herbs, and flowers</li><li>Frozen berry juice pops</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Floral</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Pick-your-own wildflower bouquets (dozens of species grown across 8 acres)</li></ul>",

Located on 17+ fertile acres in New Milford, Connecticut, the property had been a dormant farmstead dating back to the 1700s. In 2012, Bill and Amy, driven by a deep longing to live more intentionally, purchased the land and began transforming it with their own hands. Every structure on the property, from the guesthouse to the chapel, was built using trees milled right on-site, a testament to their craftsmanship and reverence for the land.</p><p id="""">The farm reflects their shared commitment to stewardship and sanctuary. Bill, once a carpenter, and Amy, a former elementary school teacher, built this place as a refuge—first for themselves, and now for all who visit. Their vision is grounded in permaculture principles and organic growing methods. Today, Finnegan’s Farm is home to Scottish Highlander cattle, goats, ducks, chickens, and two beloved horses—Ruby Tuesday and Mr. BoJangles—along with a lively crew of barn cats and their watchful Australian shepherd, Finula. From animal companionship to beekeeping and a blossoming maple syrup operation, the land is alive in every season.</p><p id="""">The name Finnegan’s Farm, West honors Amy’s Irish roots and a heritage farm still run by her family in Western Ireland. Their chapel, a handcrafted thatched-roof sanctuary, hosts intimate weddings and sacred gatherings, while a yurt and guesthouse invite overnight stays immersed in nature. Whether you come to reconnect with animals, pick up honey and produce from the farm stand, or simply breathe in the stillness of the Litchfield Hills, Finnegan’s Farm, West welcomes you to slow down and savor the quiet magic of farm life.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9fa2c5be804fb844065_homepagecowphoto.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9fad3d0c375fcac72d3_Barn%2BQuilt.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f9fdf1aa1dabb47f2b_ratio3x2_2400.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f9774ed8e13451ebd3_IMG_3996web.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f961cd08b2730dffd5_Ruby%2BTuesday.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9faca0a0ddd3d564cda_Thecows.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f98313ab9de478f92a_Mr%2BBo%2BJangles%2B2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f9199c944dbb375b19_yurtphoto.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f98875d9729e30b54f_chapel2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f96a6b1fb8aa084465_trinityknotstable.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f9ba958d150958db76_IMG_0487.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f9f5908465c842fc29_DSC_8086.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f9e1aafc1ea8124c9a_IMG_3986.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9f9d344a7a3ad6c81fd_IMG_4789.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9fa774ed8e13451ebff_IMG_2757.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9fa737957ac181649f4_IMG_8799.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9fdc51867570944be6a_Finnandduckling.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9fdf99222bf19da7c5e_Screenshot%202025-06-01%20195602.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9fcca0a0ddd3d564d64_IMG_4164.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cea005d9336ef0d30c845_Bees.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cea007125a673fd0e556f_maplesyrup.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cea00f5908465c84301e9_499047441_1339682601498445_6119028111011639432_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cea90ba65ade013de7903_Founders2.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ce9ec034dacf2e709c918_guesthousephoto.jpg,finnegansfarm55@yahoo.com,914-643-5178,"55 Upland Road, New Milford, CT 06776",https://www.finnegansfarmwest.com/,The Shack is open 10-5 from June - Oct. on a self serve honor system.,"<p id=""""><em id="""">Vegetables &amp; Fruits:</em></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">A variety of seasonal vegetables</li><li id="""">Seasonal fruits</li><li id="""">Permaculture-grown produce from a 1-acre market garden</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Herbs &amp; Flowers:</em></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Dahlias</li><li id="""">Zinnias</li><li id="""">Sunflowers</li><li id="""">30+ additional flower varieties</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Other:</em></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Honey</li><li id="""">Maple Syrup </li><li id="""">Farm-Fresh Eggs</li></ul>",

Founded by German immigrant Herman Flamig, this enduring farm has evolved through more than a century of transformation—from a 12-cow dairy to a bustling egg operation with thousands of chickens, to a flourishing organic vegetable farm. Today, it is known as much for its whimsical spirit as for its heartfelt mission, symbolized by the now-iconic backwards ""EGGS"" sign that proudly graces the red barn—a piece of art born from creativity and embraced by the town.</p><p id="""">The Christensen family, now the stewards of Flamig Farm, have created a multifaceted haven that offers more than your average agricultural experience.

Flamig Farm is also a destination for weddings, concerts, and summer camps—always infused with a spirit of joy, education, and harmony with nature. Their commitment to community extends to thoughtful children's programs, seasonal events like Earth Day and Santa visits, and the ever-popular “Eggs Around the World” initiative.</p><p id="""">At its core, Flamig Farm believes in optimism and the power of positive thinking. Their mission is to educate and inspire, encouraging all who visit to consider how we might live more consciously and sustainably on this earth. Whether it’s through feeding goats with your toddler, gathering fresh eggs, or exchanging a smile with Farmer Nevin himself, Flamig Farm offers moments of wonder that leave lasting impressions. More than a farm, it’s a living vision—blending tradition, imagination, and the deeply rooted belief that even small experiences can spark big transformations.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d9569ad0745a18f7fe7_flamig_0014_Contact.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d95443bba16d65c4a99_flamig_0013_Directions.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d9523beb24fd6fe46a2_485625890_1079157030919052_7324889969929683176_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d955ab801f8dfbb1d4e_486789150_1080441770790578_416811000073513580_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d9e017f5dde7da52d47_492768575_1104943165007105_4578053239859694893_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d967c6104b386b9b5b3_unnamed.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d958203faac93b6eb3f_486538286_1081396744028414_8179461546897961264_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68656d905f4b97dbf0aacd84_2020-10-14.webp,info@flamigfarm.com,(860) 658-5070,"7 Shingle Mill Road, West Simsbury, CT 06092-2311",https://flamigfarm.com/,"Open daily from 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM, April 1 through mid-November (weather permitting)","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Animal Products</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh, organic eggs ($7/dozen)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Animal feed cups (for petting zoo): $2 per cup / $5 for 3 cups</li></ul>",

Established in 2002 by Paul Bucciaglia, the farm grew from four bare acres into one of the region’s most respected organic producers, stewarded with care by Paul and his partner Rebecca Batchie. Together with their talented crew, they farm nearly 20 acres using time-honored ecological practices—no synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, just compost, cover crops, and soil-first principles that honor the land’s deep agrarian and Indigenous history.</p><p id="""">Paul and Rebecca are a complementary force. Paul holds degrees in agriculture and plant biology and began his path through apprenticeships and CSA management before founding Fort Hill. Rebecca, a trained horticulturist with a passion for food, transitioned from ornamental gardening to farming through her work at the farm and studies in Critical Social Thought. Their shared commitment to sustainability, community nourishment, and high-quality produce powers everything they do.</p><p id="""">Today, Fort Hill Farm serves over 300 CSA members through its innovative debit-style Harvest Card, attends multiple farmers’ markets, and sells directly through a bustling on-farm stand. Their offerings span over 225 varieties of vegetables, fruits, herbs, and flowers, including a beloved Pick-Your-Own program and a nationally recognized collection of certified organic dahlia tubers. Fort Hill is more than a farm—it is a living legacy, a place where healthy soil yields not just vibrant food, but meaningful connection.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedae7125a673fd0ff709_486726035_1135372925268085_55200847150551407_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc35ea27860a2b4710c_IMG_7784.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc212396840487b6cf7_IMG_0271.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc25d9336ef0d3271b6_DSCF3670%20(1).jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc2ba958d15095aafe8_paul_tractor_garlic_sm.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc2e9fd0ed0ef999b93_IMG_6174.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc373a0abb8067d8490_IMG_6117.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc264f80d1a6884fed0_IMG_7768-2-1024x768.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc2e9fd0ed0ef999b41_imagejpeg_0.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc2ca0a0ddd3d581201_IMG_1382.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc23d848173f845ccab_IMG_5854.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc1be844a15d184cde4_IMG_1199.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc2c018cbe8e6878fae_IMG_4965%2B(1).jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc17d79944cfdafa2fb_IMG_0532.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc1c018cbe8e6878f4f_A26C98B0-C357-481A-9F46-8E7F69082998.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc273a0abb8067d845d_491839891_1155061913299186_8123333190170145531_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc25ea27860a2b470ab_490752148_1152182280253816_6593842310169167007_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc25d87f025fe2f6a09_488178561_1141209841351060_2375889340800692449_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedc2d9c15be471fd4a49_487312342_1134494218689289_3646864234336501260_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cedab8875d9729e324fe7_481246820_3735545483424618_8919811138229902585_n.jpg,forthillfarm@gmail.com,860-350-3158,"18 Fort Hill Road, New Milford, CT 06776",https://www.forthillfarm.com/,"Farmstand: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday: 2:00 pm – 6:30 pm Saturday: 8:00 am – 12:30 pm Pick-Your-Own (PYO): Tuesday, Thursday, Friday: 1:30 pm – 7:00 pm Saturday: 7:30 am – 1:00 pm","<p id=""""><em id="""">Vegetables (Early to Late Season):</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Spinach, Lettuce, Arugula</li><li>Radishes, Salad Turnips, Scallions</li><li>Chinese Cabbage, Kale, Baby Bok Choy</li><li>Broccoli, Broccoli Raab</li><li>Sugar Snap Peas, Fennel, Radicchio, Escarole</li><li>Swiss Chard, Cabbage, Bunched Beets</li><li>Garlic Scapes, Garlic, Carrots, Beets, Leeks</li><li>Tomatoes, Cherry Tomatoes</li><li>Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Cucumbers</li><li>Onions (sweet &amp; large), Green Beans, Wax Beans</li><li>Sweet Corn, Potatoes, Eggplant</li><li>Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Sweet Potatoes</li><li>Hot &amp; Sweet Peppers, Parsnips, Celeriac</li><li>Brussels Sprouts, Winter Squash, Rutabagas<br>(<em id="""">Many crops available for PYO</em>)</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Fruit:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Strawberries</li><li>Watermelon</li><li>Cantaloupe</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Herbs:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Sage, Thyme, Chives, Oregano</li><li>A wide variety of culinary herbs</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Flowers:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Certified Organic Dahlias</li><li>Pick-Your-Own Flower Bouquets</li><li>Over 30 varieties of annual flowers</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Other:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Certified Organic Garden Seedlings (vegetables, flowers, herbs)</li><li>Maple Syrup (occasionally stocked)</li><li>CSA Shares (Harvest Card Debit System)</li><li>Farmstand Local Goods (honey, syrup, meat from other farms)</li></ul>",

It all began when Grandma and Grandpa Gazsi purchased their original land in Oxford, Connecticut, planting the seeds for a legacy that would span over a century. Their produce supplied local grocers and delis across the Naugatuck Valley, while homemade pickles and sauerkraut from their own cucumbers and cabbage were sold by relatives who ran a local butcher shop. It was a time when food was more than sustenance — it was connection, community, and care.</p><p id="""">Today, the fourth generation of the Gazsi family continues to uphold those values. Ed Gazy, along with his wife Alexis, his brothers Pete and Tony, and his children Dominic, Roseanne, Nicholas, and Albert, run the 80-acre farm with heartfelt dedication. Together, they grow roughly 25 acres of vegetables, herbs, flowers, and plants, while also harvesting up to 200 acres of hay annually. The farm uses integrated pest management techniques to ensure healthy crops with reduced reliance on synthetic chemicals, striking a balance between environmental stewardship and flavor-rich produce. During the season, you’ll find them at farmers markets across Fairfield and New Haven counties, as well as at their welcoming roadside stand in Oxford.</p><p id="""">Gazy Brothers Farm is not just a place to buy vegetables — it's a way to reconnect with seasonal rhythms, regional bounty, and the heart of Connecticut agriculture. Through their CSA program, flower shares, farm stand, and vibrant presence at weekly markets, the Gazsi family invites the community into their story — one woven through soil, sun, and family heritage. Their deep roots in the land and love for what they grow are evident in every harvest, carrying forward a century-old mission: to feed families freshly, and to do so with joy, pride, and purpose.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68950b7cd8f9eccddde1287c_Broccoli-225x300.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68950b7efa2cab82b104bc05_PackingCSABoxes-300x225.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68950b80aab6743580d0bba0_SquashRows-300x225.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68950b8cb21538af89f93ff5_MarketCarrotsBeets-300x225.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689516f75df1133ad2a559cb_506668241_10162439747785256_8936556110246039296_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895171005ee2fe2d3fbef3d_504754275_10162407743365256_8370574362397763502_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689517b350eab6c86fdbbef6_67199340_10157204326725256_8052364841576300544_n.jpg,gazybrothersfarm1918@gmail.com,(203) 592‑5074,"391 Chestnut Tree Hill Rd, Oxford, CT 06478",gazybrothersfarm.net,Call for hours,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Russet potatoes</li><li>Red potatoes</li><li>White potatoes</li><li>Yukon gold potatoes</li><li>Blue/purple potatoes</li><li>Fingerling potatoes</li><li>French fingerling potatoes</li><li>Sweet potatoes</li><li>White sweet potatoes</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Red cherry radishes</li><li>Icicle radishes</li><li>Red meat (watermelon) radishes</li><li>French breakfast radishes</li><li>Red/purple beets</li><li>Golden beets</li><li>Purple top turnips</li><li>Yellow turnips (rutabaga)</li><li>Hakurei turnips</li><li>Green cabbage</li><li>Red cabbage</li><li>Savoy cabbage</li><li>Brussels sprouts</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Bok choy</li><li>Beet greens</li><li>Collard greens</li><li>Dandelion greens</li><li>Kale</li><li>Mustard greens</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Red (ruby) Swiss chard</li><li>White Swiss chard</li><li>Rainbow (bright lights) Swiss chard</li><li>Turnip greens</li><li>Boston lettuce</li><li>Buttercrunch lettuce</li><li>Green leaf lettuce</li><li>Iceberg lettuce</li><li>Oak leaf lettuce</li><li>Red leaf lettuce</li><li>Romaine lettuce</li><li>Arugula</li><li>Mizuna</li><li>Green asparagus</li><li>Purple asparagus</li><li>Celery</li><li>Okra</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (from Deercrest &amp; Bussa Orchards, Glastonbury)</li><li>Peaches (from Deercrest &amp; Bussa Orchards)</li><li>Plums (from Deercrest &amp; Bussa Orchards)</li><li>Nectarines (from Deercrest &amp; Bussa Orchards)</li><li>Pears (from Deercrest &amp; Bussa Orchards)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry/Other</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Bicolor corn (butter &amp; sugar, honey &amp; cream, sugar &amp; gold)</li><li>White corn</li><li>Yellow corn</li></ul>",

In 1979, the farm became one of the first in the state to achieve certified organic status, a commitment it proudly upholds today through the Baystate Organic Certifiers.</p><p id="""">Now managed by George’s nephew Daren Hall, along with his wife Janet and their three children, the farm spans over 50 acres dedicated to the production of diverse, nutrient-rich vegetables. With the addition of hoop houses to extend the growing season and a deep investment in heirloom and specialty crops, the farm produces high-quality food from early spring through late winter. Alongside produce, the farm is also home to egg-laying hens, honey bees, and pasture-raised pork.</p><p id="""">George Hall Farm is more than a working farm—it’s an educational space and a community hub. It offers robust CSA programs, participates in top farmers' markets, and invites the next generation through student programs and internships. Daren’s team of trained oxen, Moe and Curly and Eli and Sam, even contribute to the farm’s unique charm, drawing interest from families and children. Rooted in tradition yet forward-looking in practice, George Hall Farm remains a model for sustainable farming and community-supported agriculture in New England.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff1d733ccfb826c0ad2_3M2A0325.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff1e677842b98c4cfcb_3M2A0344.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff09c868df2f8cb62e5_486022615_1061274336043571_7732792754562148687_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff0a566512e0115b6cd_486297335_1059622462875425_608878753806518239_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff076bb76d8efb62963_485357603_1057436219760716_6309463938552659826_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff0dd8ec02d7c10191e_484855650_1057436196427385_4412998377476838735_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff0889e563a056ad978_485175425_1057436173094054_1931671749010449016_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff1d89a7b474e956f77_3M2A0530.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff1d89a7b474e956f6f_759.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375ff1982dbe89c56be8ae_3M2A0466.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68375fea35a36b60aad27353_roof%2Band%2Bsunflowers.jpg,georgehallfarm@gmail.com,(860) 658-9297,"180 Old Farms Rd, Simsbury, CT 06070",https://www.georgehallfarm.com/,,"<p id=""""><em id="""">Vegetables (Seasonally Available):</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Arugula</li><li>Asparagus</li><li>Beets</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Brussels Sprouts</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Chinese Greens</li><li>Collards</li><li>Sweet Corn</li><li>Cucumbers</li><li>Daikon</li><li>Edamame Soybeans</li><li>Eggplant</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Green Beans</li><li>Hot Peppers</li><li>Kale</li><li>Kohlrabi</li><li>Leeks</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Mustard Greens</li><li>Okra</li><li>Onions</li><li>Parsnips</li><li>Peas</li><li>Potatoes</li><li>Pumpkins</li><li>Radishes</li><li>Rutabagas</li><li>Salad Greens</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Summer Squash</li><li>Sweet Peppers</li><li>Sweet Potatoes</li><li>Swiss Chard</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Turnips</li><li>Winter Squash</li><li>Zucchini</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Fruits:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Rhubarb</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Cantaloupes</li><li>Melons</li><li>Watermelons</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Meats/Livestock:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Pork</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Dairy/Eggs:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Eggs</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Processed Goods:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Honey</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Herbs:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh Herbs</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Flowers:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh Flowers</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">Specialty Items:</em></p><ul id=""""><li>Firewood</li><li>Wreaths</li><li>Gourds</li></ul>",

With locations in both Westport and Easton, Gilbertie’s has become a destination for home gardeners, chefs, health-conscious families, and plant lovers alike.</p><p id="""">At the heart of Gilbertie’s is a deep reverence for soil-grown, organic cultivation.

The result is a nutrient-dense, intensely flavorful product unmatched by hydroponic alternatives. With over 400 varieties of herbs and vegetables and more than 40 microgreen blends, Gilbertie’s offerings serve both retail shoppers and wholesale partners across the Northeast.</p><p id="""">But Gilbertie’s is more than a farm—it’s a community hub, a classroom, and a sanctuary for anyone seeking connection to nature.

Unlike his forebears who raised livestock, Christopher envisioned a farm devoted entirely to fruits and vegetables, where community members could immerse themselves in the joy of pick-your-own produce. Over time, he expanded the farm's offerings from a single acre of strawberries to include blueberries, raspberries, pumpkins, and a bounty of seasonal vegetables—anchored by customer favorites like sweet corn and tomatoes.</p><p id="""">Together with his wife Michelle, Christopher has woven his family legacy into the soil of Lisbon, Connecticut. The farm now spans over 12 acres, enriched by three greenhouses that extend the harvest season into early June. Beyond the fields, the farm operates a thriving roadside stand, participates in local farmers markets, and supports the community through a Farm Share CSA program.

Founded by Czechoslovakian immigrant Joseph Halas Sr., the original family enterprise was a self-sufficient dairy farm nestled on Bear Mountain Road in Danbury. With 30 cows, the Halases produced milk, cream, eggs, and other dairy goods for their community. Through the trials of war and loss, the Halas family’s strength and devotion to their land and one another never wavered. Joseph’s son, Paul Halas Sr., returned from WWII to carry on the legacy, eventually founding the Pembroke Road farm market in 1969 alongside his sister “Aunt Peggy.”</p><p id="""">The modern Halas Farm Market now flourishes under the care of Michael Halas, the youngest of Paul’s ten children. With a degree in mechanical engineering and a deep love for the land instilled from childhood, Michael reimagined the family farm with an eye toward sustainability. He introduced ecologically responsible practices and constructed a state-of-the-art greenhouse that remains the heart of the business today. Though not organically certified, the farm is committed to safe, chemical-free growing practices, and its fields yield an extraordinary variety of vibrant, nutrient-rich produce.</p><p id="""">From the charm of an 18th-century horse barn to the bustling seasonal rhythms of their CSA program, Halas Farm Market is more than a business—it is a legacy of resilience, family, and stewardship. Michael now resides in the restored 250-year-old home beside the market with his wife and three children, the fourth generation of Halases to rise with the sun and tend to the land. Visitors to the farm are welcomed not only by the bounty of fresh vegetables, fruits, eggs, and herbs but by the warm, enduring spirit of a farm that has weathered generations with grace and pride.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876d03aa841b67c6dae088a_514353123_1269680861826007_522275166225664507_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876d039232e794d2989faa2_518386559_1281936417267118_3422445005457874592_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876d03a0c0bcd2427a7c110_516294405_18414814546098689_6297579146637301234_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876d03af6b383eb2c854911_517409575_1275936337867126_4078863343945068882_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876d03a0fef94507f6833b4_ratio3x2_1920.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6876d0337f613072f8f1d7d8_rawImage.jpg,info@halasfarm.com,(203) 746-4606,"28 Pembroke Road, Danbury, CT 06811",http://www.halasfarm.com/,Monday – Friday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM Saturday: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM Sunday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Arugula</li><li>Lettuce (Romaine, Red &amp; Green Leaf, Buttercrunch)</li><li>Kale (3 varieties)</li><li>Beans (Green – French type, Yellow Wax, Purple)</li><li>Broccoli, Broccoli Rabe, Romanesco</li><li>Cabbage, Napa Cabbage, Bok Choi</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Escarole</li><li>Swiss Chard</li><li>Endive</li><li>Leeks</li><li>Shallots</li><li>Fennel</li><li>Purslane</li><li>Onions</li><li>Scallions</li><li>Chives</li><li>Beets (Red, Gold, White)</li><li>Turnips</li><li>Parsnips</li><li>Radish (White, Red, Watermelon)</li><li>Carrots (Purple &amp; Orange)</li><li>Brussels Sprouts</li><li>Cauliflower (White, Purple, Cheddar)</li><li>Peas &amp; Sugar Peas</li><li>Sweet Corn (Butter &amp; Sugar)</li><li>Squash (Green, Yellow, Patty Pan, Eight Ball, Butternut, Acorn, Spaghetti, Honey Nut, Mashed Potatoes Acorn)</li><li>Zucchini</li><li>Cucumbers (Slicers, Picklers, Burpless)</li><li>Tomatoes (Heirloom, Cherry)</li><li>Eggplant (Purple, White, Japanese)</li><li>Hot Peppers (Poblanos, Long Hots, Cherry Hots, Habaneros &amp; more)</li><li>Sweet Peppers (Yellow, Red, Green, Purple, Frying Peppers)</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Garlic Scapes</li><li>Pumpkins</li><li>Gourds</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruits:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (locally grown)</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Blueberries</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Parsley</li><li>Basil</li><li>Mint</li><li>Rosemary</li><li>Cilantro</li><li>Oregano</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eggs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh free-range eggs from Halas Farm's own chickens</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other Local Goods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Maple syrup</li><li>Local honey</li><li>Preserves</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Non-Food Items:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Annuals, Perennials</li><li>Vegetable &amp; Herb Plants</li><li>Ornamental Trees &amp; Shrubs</li><li>Garden Supplies (Soil, Compost, Fertilizer, Mulch)</li><li>Lawn Care (Coast of Maine, Jonathan Green)</li><li>Pottery, Statuary, Garden Fountains</li><li>Gifts &amp; Patio Accents</li></ul>",

In 2020, Valentina—now the principal grower—relocated from Belarus to Hartford, Connecticut, amid the country’s political upheaval. Settling into her daughter Anastasiya and son-in-law Matt’s home in West Hartford, Valentina’s natural gift with plants soon transformed from a personal pastime into something much more. What began with propagating begonias and tending to flowers around their home evolved into a passion for cultivating microgreens, ultimately blooming into the Hartford Plant Company.</p><p id="""">By February 2021, the trio had gone from kitchen-counter experiments to producing and delivering vibrant, nutrient-rich microgreens to homes and restaurants across Greater Hartford. As the business grew, so did the need for space, and by mid-2021 they moved into a commercial kitchen at the Swift Factory, a historic redevelopment project near Keney Park. Their produce now supplies restaurants across Hartford, Glastonbury, Middletown, Essex, New Haven, and Old Saybrook. The company remains a staple at the West Hartford Farmers’ Market and continues to offer convenient pickup and local deliveries to individual customers.</p><p id="""">At its core, the Hartford Plant Company is driven by values of family, health, and sustainability. All microgreens are organically grown and harvested the same day they're delivered, ensuring exceptional flavor and nutritional potency. From spicy radish mixes to aromatic cilantro and power-packed broccoli shoots, their greens are not only a culinary delight but also a quiet revolution—offering a tangible way to eat better, waste less, and support local growers rooted in resilience and care.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d99805d636739c471_prod5.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4dc30a81ca10bb06b3_prod6.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4e60f80954fa27bbfc_prod7.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d5b2b38ce73fa2e04_prod8.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4ddf1ef45c7d45f429_prod9.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d29c349ce222acdcd_prod10.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d4a616d278c1624b8_prod11.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d07e0d59769fc3f62_prod12.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4dc024e4491c2b464f_prod13.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d8cde3b1c1c94e57c_prod1.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4db0ecaa8326e092fb_prod2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d1e3fb4197986cc98_prod3.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d4d7799db15c445bac7_prod4.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506d47c99471b8dc0d159a_about.jpg,matt@hartfordplantco.com,(860) 999-3037,"10 Love Lane, Hartford, CT 06122",https://hartfordplantco.com/,Delivery,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Microgreens:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Rainbow Mix</li><li>Spicy Mix</li><li>Cilantro</li><li>Arugula</li><li>Basil</li><li>Wheatgrass</li><li>Broccoli Microgreens</li><li>Kale Microgreens</li><li>Pea Microgreens</li><li>Radish Microgreens</li><li>Sunflower Microgreens</li><li>Red Cabbage Microgreens</li></ul>",

Founded in 2017 by James Wargo, a native of Woodbury, this young orchard has quickly grown into one of Connecticut’s most distinctive apple farms. Established on land once part of the Southbury Training School farm, Hidden Gem now boasts over 4,000 dwarf apple trees planted on just six acres. With a sharp focus on cultivating both antique and modern apple varieties, James has curated an orchard that blends horticultural science with old-world charm — from 16th-century French apples like Calville Blanc to newly released Cornell hybrids like Cordera and Firecracker.</p><p id="""">James Wargo brings deep-rooted expertise to the farm. Armed with a degree in Horticulture from UConn and a Master of Science in Pomology from Cornell, he has spent over two decades working in fruit science, product development, and applied field research across the eastern United States. After nearly 20 years away, James returned to Connecticut to fulfill a lifelong dream: owning and operating a fruit farm. His passion is evident in every branch of Hidden Gem — where apples are grown on a vertical axe training system that maximizes sunlight, yield, and flavor. His approach is informed, intentional, and infused with reverence for both the science and soul of apple farming.</p><p id="""">Hidden Gem Orchard offers a peaceful, non-commercial apple picking experience that feels more like stepping into a storybook than a roadside attraction. Guests are invited to meander through rows of conical, fruit-laden trees, enjoy scenic hayrides, and discover rare apple varieties whose names and flavors evoke centuries of cultivation history. With over 30 apple types — including prized heirlooms for fresh eating, baking, and cider — and new ventures like seedless table grapes on the horizon, Hidden Gem Orchard continues to evolve while staying grounded in its mission: to grow remarkable fruit with integrity, curiosity, and quiet beauty.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895181d0b476abe7f610c3b_20170915_182838.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689518209cd27a098d93a35e_20171112_155525.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689518320d8a497c1c57c915_GW-573.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895186ff2878843bbc9b98e_494503260_699044366145370_6593154927714921596_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689518808278bf4303539887_463388722_18023230163410031_6388017580250412795_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895188c763946bd392274c1_484008950_660876766628797_5694712314348344120_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68951899cd18400ec84f112a_482031362_660866233296517_2103905277174930478_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689518a68b82929a4aa9f8d0_484468074_660711773311963_5101517347475327634_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689518ae1009c0c68363ec67_484402451_660711723311968_3345513004797959857_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689518b300b3c2ceae03d26b_481903146_658043916912082_4456791693465360736_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895181a60a690c85c3814a5_013.webp,hiddengemorchard@gmail.com,,"2500 Purchase Brook Rd, Southbury, CT 06488",hiddengemorchard.com,Call/email for hours,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><em id="""">Apples (32+ varieties):</em><ul id=""""><li>Ashmead’s Kernel (antique)</li><li>Baldwin (antique)</li><li>Calville Blanc (antique)</li><li>Chisel Jersey</li><li>Cordera</li><li>Cortland</li><li>Cox Orange Pippin (antique)</li><li>Crimson Crisp</li><li>Empire</li><li>Esopus Spitzenburg (antique)</li><li>Firecracker</li><li>Fuji</li><li>Gala</li><li>Golden Delicious</li><li>Golden Russet (antique)</li><li>Grimes Golden</li><li>Honeycrisp</li><li>Hudson Golden Gem</li><li>Jonagold</li><li>Jonathan</li><li>Macoun</li><li>McIntosh</li><li>Mutsu (Crispin)</li><li>Northern Spy (antique)</li><li>Pink Lady</li><li>Pink Luster</li><li>Pink Pearl</li><li>Porters Perfection (hard cider use only)</li><li>Rosalee</li><li>Triumph</li><li>Wickson</li><li>Winesap (antique)</li></ul></li><li id=""""><em id="""">Grapes (Seedless Table Grapes – coming soon):</em><ul id=""""><li>Marquis (white)</li><li>Vanessa (red)</li></ul></li></ul>",

For over a decade, this land has been in the hands of the Hoadley family, now in its fourth generation, who began farming as a hobby to feed their family better, cleaner food. What began with a few chickens gifted by Tyler Hoadley’s father has blossomed into a thriving regenerative farm producing some of the most nutrient-dense meats and eggs in the region.</p><p id="""">At the heart of Hoadley Hills is a deep commitment to regenerative agriculture—a philosophy that centers on restoring soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and respecting the natural rhythms of animal life. All animals are rotationally grazed, moved regularly to fresh pasture, and fed a carefully considered diet free from antibiotics, hormones, and synthetic additives. Their pigs enjoy organic grain and whey from Arethusa, their poultry forages daily on vibrant fields, and their Eggmobile system ensures hens lay rich, creamy-yolked eggs with access to endless fresh forage.</p><p id="""">The farm is stewarded by Tyler and Haley, whose paths crossed while working on a Connecticut vegetable farm. Their shared passion for a grounded, seasonal life and traditional, nourishing food became the foundation for both a life and a farm built with care and purpose. Together, they’ve turned a dream into a practice—offering their community more than just meat and eggs, but a true model of sustainability, transparency, and reverence for the land.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687531457c4aec3898777053_Tyler%2BHoadley%2B-%2BHoadley%2BHills%2BFarm%2BCT%2B-%2BDrinking.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6875314524739899f4e1bec8_Tyler%2BHoadley%2B-%2BHoadley%2BHills%2BFarm%2B-%2BLayers%2Band%2BCows.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687531452bd6b94fdc8d0e4a_Chick%20Pic.webp,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68753142ca1eb5b80263c962_Tyler%2BHoadley%2B-%2BHoadley%2BHills%2BFarm%2B-%2BWorking.jpeg,,,"27 Jennings Road, South Kent, CT 06785",https://www.hoadleyhillsfarm.com/,No farm store – pick-ups by appointment only though online store,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Pork</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Bone-in Pork Loin Chop</li><li>Boston Butt Roast</li><li>Picnic Shoulder Roast</li><li>Ground Pork</li><li>Pork Leaf Lard (for rendering)</li><li>Rendered Leaf Lard</li><li>Rendered Pork Lard</li><li id="""">Pork Sausage (varieties)</li><li id="""">Salame (varieties)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Chicken</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Whole Chicken (Medium &amp; Large)</li><li>Half Chicken</li><li>Chicken Breast (Bone-in &amp; Boneless)</li><li>Chicken Thigh (Bone-in &amp; Boneless)</li><li>Chicken Leg Quarters</li><li>Chicken Drumsticks</li><li>Chicken Wings</li><li>Chicken Livers</li><li>Chicken Hearts</li><li>Chicken Feet</li><li>Chicken Backs</li><li>Ground Chicken</li><li>Chicken Bone Broth</li><li>Stewing Hens</li><li>Spatchcocked/Butterflied Chickens</li><li id="""">Chicken Sausage (varieties)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Turkey</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Whole Thanksgiving Turkeys</li><li>Ground Turkey</li><li>Turkey Drumsticks</li><li>Turkey Wings</li><li id="""">Turkey Sausages</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Beef</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Ground Beef</li><li>Steaks</li><li>Roasts</li><li>Other assorted cuts</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eggs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Pasture-Raised Eggs (Eggmobile system)</li><li>Weekly Egg CSA Box (seasonal)</li></ul>",

For over two centuries, the land was lovingly stewarded by the Holcomb family, culminating in a generous gift to the University of Connecticut in 1976 by siblings Tudor and Laura Holcomb. Their vision was to preserve the land for agricultural research, education, and conservation. In 1990, ownership transitioned to the Town of Granby, and since then, the nonprofit <strong id="""">Friends of Holcomb Farm</strong> has breathed new life into the property—restoring its legacy as a working farm and enriching it with a deeply community-focused mission.</p><p id="""">Today, Holcomb Farm thrives as a non-profit, chemical-free production farm growing on 26 acres of conserved land. Their CSA program serves over 500 households across summer and winter seasons, while the on-site Farm Store offers fresh produce alongside locally crafted goods and pantry staples. Central to Holcomb’s ethos is its <em id="""">Fresh Access</em> initiative—a program that distributes tens of thousands of pounds of nutrient-dense produce to food-insecure families throughout Hartford County and beyond. Their farming practices are rooted in sustainability: composting, crop rotation, cover cropping, beneficial insects, and flame weeding are all thoughtfully applied to ensure that every harvest nurtures both people and the planet.</p><p id="""">Beyond the fields, Holcomb Farm has evolved into a hub for education, recreation, and celebration. Its 312 acres include over ten miles of public trails, a renowned Tree Trail arboretum, and a historic barn available for community events. Classes, yoga sessions, volunteer days, and youth programs are held throughout the seasons, creating a space where locals and visitors alike can connect to nature, wellness, and one another.

The farm’s story began in the 1850s with Philip James Jones, a man whose timeless words—“Be good to the land and the land will be good to you”—continue to guide every generation of Jones farmers today. From these humble beginnings, the Jones family has stewarded the land with passion, care, and an unwavering commitment to community.</p><p id="""">In the decades that followed, each generation left its own mark—most notably Terry Jones, who returned to the farm in the mid-20th century and introduced strawberries as a new crop. Known lovingly as the “perfect fruit,” strawberries became a beloved summer tradition for thousands of families across the region. Over time, the farm expanded its offerings to include blueberries, pumpkins, Christmas trees, and a celebrated winery, creating a full calendar of harvest experiences that honor both the land and the people who cherish it.</p><p id="""">Beyond its crops, Jones Family Farms is a living embodiment of sustainable farming.

The Jones family invites all who visit to be good to the land—and to one another.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781283fdfded11e648ab85_download%20(3).jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781283f7a67c150cdbf85a_download%20(4).jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781284ae927fd4d1c47ff2_IMG_0002.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781283d6e86a6bbee34b2a_Fall-Drone-Winery-2_0.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781283048946318fd0246e_butterfly-sunflower.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781283e14324da53a3f68c_IMG_9265.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781283954bf1b86c5f2ae9_3_baskets_of_berries_0.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6878128346c7221e0ece1a3d_Fall-Drone-PSH-4.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781282ee419004e0128197_Fall-Pumpkins-PSH-2-1.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781282da289a276eee2efb_Fall-Pumpkins-Dog-Skye-Winery_r2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687812830680537403c3bb38_Fall-Pumpkins-Truck-Sunset-wine-barrels.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6878128232484b77d15b99c5_harvest-farm.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687812827c6123fa0cf621dc_download.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687812830e49f2d0960e8286_download%20(1).jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6878128222887d01719a54a9_download%20(2).jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6878129c0a3904f12497282e_Fall-Drone-Winery_0.jpg,,(203) 929-8425,"Homestead: 606 Walnut Tree Hill Road, Shelton, CT 06484",https://www.jonesfamilyfarms.com/,Hours vary due to weather and picking conditions.

The farm’s origins date back to 1920, when Joseph Preli and his wife Rose arrived from Northern Italy and settled into the rich soil of the Connecticut River Valley. From the very beginning, Joseph nurtured the land with care, planting Concord grapes and crafting wines for family and friends with Old World methods and timeless pride.</p><p id="""">As the decades passed, the Preli family’s agricultural legacy flourished. Joseph and Rose raised six daughters who carried forward both the farm and the winemaking tradition, stewarding the land and keeping alive the rituals that shaped their childhood. Today, that heritage lives on through Joseph’s grandson John and his partner Jeanne, who now operate the farm with reverence for the past and a renewed vision for the future. Together, they have restored antique tractors, cultivated a lush landscape of produce, and opened a boutique winery—welcoming the community to gather, sip, and celebrate the beauty of local craftsmanship.</p><p id="""">Every bottle of wine, jar of jam, and basket of fresh-picked produce at Joseph Preli Farm &amp; Winery speaks to a commitment to purity, sustainability, and soul. From naturally fermented hard ciders and hand-harvested garlic scapes to beeswax candles and rare heirloom tomatoes, the farm honors a simpler time while embracing the joy of sharing that richness with others. It is not just a place to buy food—it is a place to experience the land, taste the season, and feel the enduring warmth of a family that has made this corner of Connecticut their life’s masterpiece.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/682f45e23d9c5f90123076de_2%20(12).png;

For much of the twentieth century, it was a working dairy operation, but in 1986, the family pivoted away from commodity milk and toward hay, beef, and livestock—laying the groundwork for a diversified, sustainable farm focused on direct-to-consumer relationships. Today, it is lovingly run by the third and fourth generations, with a fifth generation of young helpers never far from the fields or barns.</p><p id="""">Spanning over 400 acres, Kalenauskas Farm carefully tends to more than 250 head of livestock and manages vast hay and corn silage production to feed its animals. Every detail of the farm’s operation reflects a commitment to sustainability and humane animal care—from cover cropping and reduced tillage to maximizing pasture access and ensuring animals receive nutritious, consistent feed. This reverence for land and livestock is palpable in every cut of beef and lamb, every jar of honey, every lovingly felted wool item on their market shelves.</p><p id="""">In 2020, the family opened <strong id="""">Kalenauskas Farm Market</strong>, a retail outpost offering 100% farm-produced goods—from USDA beef and lamb to maple syrup, handcrafted soaps, and wooden gifts. Karen’s Lambs, a beloved offshoot of the farm, showcases lamb, goats, and wool products at festivals and farmers markets across Connecticut.

Born from David's aspiration to explore better, easier methods of apple cultivation, Kollas Orchard took root in 1975 as a personal experiment in thoughtful farming. David, deeply immersed in the science of fruit production, brought to the soil his vast experience as the Extension Fruit Specialist at the University of Connecticut, where for 30 years he served as a trusted advisor to commercial growers across the region.</p><p id="""">Though now retired from their formal careers, David and Janet have turned what was once a side endeavor into the cornerstone of their lives. For Janet, a retired elementary school teacher from Hartford, the farm fulfilled a lifelong yearning to live close to the land. Together, their work is marked by diligent experimentation — trying, testing, and refining practices to see what truly benefits a small, family-run, retail orchard. Their approach is both methodical and deeply personal, guided not only by scientific rigor but also by a commitment to meaningful, hands-on labor.</p><p id="""">At the core of Kollas Orchard are their three distinct goals: to grow fruit known for its exceptional flavor, to improve low-cost and effective farm practices accessible to small family farms, and to champion the viability of retail orcharding as a rewarding and achievable career. With every grafted branch and every crate of hand-picked apples, David and Janet are not only growing food — they are cultivating a vision of sustainable, thoughtful farming that enriches lives both on and beyond the orchard.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d33e377516719c382d009_486485665_1080156037472700_8298047078166134818_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d33e99dce27cfc5e29056_482322225_1080508644104106_5695778270202289991_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d33ee164bf084f5093642_483564623_1070819381739699_2858366236829679763_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d33f70fe06c2b1afa4c92_308864603_460635682758075_1067940094668212900_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d33fc82f4a5eaf696e176_480533397_9129850260429499_7957855469394062012_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d33d36a17214fbedd0a5f_486597985_1080818607406443_5085687406848208649_n.jpg,kollasorchardct@gmail.com,(860) 871‑0120,"41 New Rd, Tolland, CT 06084",kollasorchardct.com,"Fall (Sept–Nov): Wed–Fri 1 PM–5 PM, Sat–Sun 10 AM–5 PM; winter (Nov 25 onward) Fri–Sat 10 AM–4 PM, Sun 12 PM–4 PM","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Apples</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Summered</li><li>Paulared</li><li>Jonamac</li><li>Gala</li><li>Honeycrisp</li><li>Britemac</li><li>Sweet Sixteen</li><li>Red Baron</li><li>Cortland</li><li>Macoun</li><li>Jonagold</li><li>Spencer</li><li>Empire</li><li>Yellow Delicious</li><li>Mutsu</li><li>Red Delicious</li><li>Melrose</li><li>Esopus Spitzenburg</li><li>Fuji</li><li>Winter Moon</li><li>Lizzie</li></ul>",

The story began in the early 1900s when John Rogowski immigrated to the United States and planted the first seeds of Laurel Glen after leaving work in Pennsylvania’s coal mines. Originally a 100-acre dairy farm, the business evolved with the times, and by the 1970s, shifted to beef and hay under the stewardship of Peter and Alexander Rogowski.</p><p id="""">In 2013, the next chapter began when Randy Rogowski returned to his roots and transformed the farm into a thriving, sustainable vegetable operation. Together with his partner Victoria, who brings warmth and creativity to community engagement and CSA management, the family reimagined the farm not only as a source of nourishment, but as a hub for connection. Whether through weekly subscription boxes, pick-your-own days, or potluck breakfasts, Laurel Glen has become a beloved gathering place that centers around wholesome food and heartfelt hospitality.</p><p id="""">Today, every bunch of Swiss chard, jar of Sunday Sauce, or pint of just-picked raspberries represents more than a product—it is the culmination of generational labor, environmental stewardship, and genuine love for feeding others. Laurel Glen is proud to use sustainable practices including crop rotation, IPM, composting, biodegradable mulch, and drip irrigation to preserve the land they’ve cherished for over a century. As Randy and Victoria raise their young children among the rows and tractors, they continue to write the farm’s story—with humility, joy, and deep gratitude for the community that supports it.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781827e9634cf3eb96d645_FullSize_Landscape_8.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781827a496d6d0155b49ea_IMG_1678.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6878182796bf636ceefa27b4_f56a88_2020deb143044ad799b5e5d4e55367b3~mv2.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781827f96562b2715fb1a7_476276317_656020920097221_8156697526222296525_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781827cb6bac096357f8d3_475642203_2939362506212627_1929083880120701601_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781823b520b6c1c569a7db_468528878_18277037896220778_6386875313386713258_n.jpg,laurelglenfarm@gmail.com,(203) 305-9179,"Farm Store: 247 Waverly Road, Shelton, CT 06484, Pick-Your-Own Fields (""The Fields at Laurel Glen Farm""): 475 Booth Hill Road, Shelton, CT 06484",https://www.laurelglenfarm.com/,"May 3 – December 7, 2025: Mon: 10:30 AM – 4:00 PM Tue–Thu: 10:30 AM – 6:00 PM Fri: 10:30 AM – 3:00 PM Sat: 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM Sun: 10:00 AM – 3:00 PM","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables (All Grown On-Site):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Tomatoes (including plum, heirloom, and tomato seconds)</li><li>Cucumbers (including pickling)</li><li>Peas (snap and others)</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Swiss chard</li><li>Zucchini (green and yellow)</li><li>Summer squash</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Broccoli (6+ varieties seasonally)</li><li>Radicchio</li><li>Kohlrabi</li><li>Husk cherries</li><li>Over 80 seasonal varieties in total (CSA &amp; farm store only sell their own harvest)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Raspberries (pick-your-own)</li><li>Strawberries (pick-your-own)</li><li>Grapes (limited, grown on-site)</li><li>Blackberries (occasionally available)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Pick-your-own fresh cut bouquets (with reusable transport cups)</li><li>Potted tulips (spring)</li><li>Hanging baskets (Mother’s Day sale)</li><li>Mums (fall)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eggs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Farm-fresh eggs from a small flock of chickens (limited availability)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Canned Goods (Made In-House):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>“Just a Crush” crushed tomatoes</li><li>Sunday Sauce (classic marinara)</li><li>Butternut Squash Sauce</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Bulk Boxes (Seasonal):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Pickling cucumbers (25 lbs)</li><li>Plum tomatoes (25 lbs)</li><li>Tomato seconds (25 lbs)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Partnered Local Goods (In Farm Store):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Meat, milk, eggs – Shaggy Coos Farm</li><li>Apples (fall) – Hindinger Farm</li><li>Cheese – Cato Corner Farm</li><li>Kombucha – Cross Culture Kombucha</li><li>Pasta – Durante’s Pasta</li><li>Jerky – Field Trip Snacks</li><li>Olive oils, vinegars, salts – Dash 'N Drizzle</li><li>Coffee – Redding Roasters Coffee Co., Rise Brewing Co.</li><li>Salami – Oui Charcuterie</li><li>Chips – Rose Sisters Chips</li><li>Cookies – Savor Fine Foods</li><li>Honey, maple syrup – Sugar Maple Farm</li><li>Yogurt – Stani Dairy</li><li>Jams, relishes – Twin Pines Farm</li><li>Bread &amp; pastries – Wave Hill Bread</li><li>Teas – Seasonal Catering</li><li>Tzatziki – Telios</li><li>Kimchi – Hawthorne Valley Ferments</li><li>Natural soap, lip balm – Treefort Naturals</li><li>Protein bars – Amrita Health Foods</li><li>Cocktail/mocktail mixes – One Part Co.</li></ul>",

Focused on sustainable agriculture, they grow a wide variety of certified organic vegetables and microgreens for most of the year, operating from April through December.</p><p id="""">The farm offers several ways for customers to access fresh produce, including a weekly veggie box membership, an online store, and an on-site honor system farm stand. Each week, members of the veggie plan have the opportunity to hand-pick their favorites from a market-style selection, ensuring freshness and minimizing waste. The online store—and corresponding weekly email alerts—keeps customers informed about what's available and when to pick it up. The farm stand, open during the growing season, also carries locally produced goods, fostering a stronger connection with surrounding farms and producers.</p><p id="""">More than just a source of food, Long Lane Farm fosters community and connection. With offerings like CSA coaching, recipe ideas, and a private Facebook group, they aim to educate and inspire their customers. Their mission is simple yet powerful: to help people cook more nourishing meals at home using produce that is fresher and more flavorful than what one might find in a standard grocery store. All while cultivating a space where people can reconnect with where their food comes from and build relationships with those who grow it.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bb0601105a91db914b91a8_542761485_1201063155386268_5301878140175297329_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bb06139214d1f0ff15da23_528388677_18419549293100121_2840553474539997491_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bb061f52239974b535b60b_519085018_1168584965300754_7343721757582447275_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bb0628b737921b368e218b_499866428_18408472768100121_4655388206798679354_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68bb06349e0d0182f1ec2583_488261511_18401364796100121_7237095109093063670_n.jpg,longlaneproduce@gmail.com,(401) 360-4311,"39 Long Lane, Warren, RI 02885",https://www.longlanefarmri.com/,Farm stand open April to December or Order Online,"<h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li>Asian Eggplant</li><li>Baby Bok Choi</li><li>Beets</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Celery</li><li>Cherry Tomatoes</li><li>Cherry Tomatoes Bulk</li><li>Collard Greens</li><li>Curly Kale</li><li>Eggplant (Fairytale)</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Green Beans</li><li>Greenleaf Lettuce</li><li>Jalapeño Pepper</li><li>Kohlrabi</li><li>Onions</li><li>Onions (10 lb bag)</li><li>Pink Heirloom Tomatoes</li><li>Radishes</li><li>Roma Tomatoes</li><li>Roma Tomatoes Bulk</li><li>Salad Mix</li><li>Salad Mix Family Size</li><li>Swiss Chard</li><li>Tuscan Kale</li><li>Yellow Heirloom Tomatoes</li><li>Black Heirloom Tomatoes (Sold Out)</li><li>B Grade Heirloom Tomato Flat</li><li>Italian Eggplant Plant (Sold Out)</li></ul><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li>Cilantro</li><li>Oregano</li><li>Oregano Bulk</li><li>Sage</li><li>Thyme</li><li>Thyme Bulk</li><li>Holy Basil Bunch</li><li>Holy Basil Bulk</li></ul><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Microgreens &amp; Greens</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li>Baby Arugula</li><li>Farmers Favorite Micro Salad</li><li>Farmers Favorite Micro Salad Family Size</li><li>Micro Broccoli</li><li>Micro Broccoli Family Size</li><li>Micro Chinese Cabbage</li><li>Micro Radish</li><li>Micro Radish Family Size</li><li>Micro Rainbow Mix</li><li>Micro Rainbow Mix Family Size</li><li>Micro Purple Cabbage</li><li>Pea Shoots</li><li>Pea Shoots Family Size</li></ul>",

Founded by Jonathon Hurlbut on land granted by the King of England, the farm began as a humble subsistence operation with livestock and crops. Over generations, the Hurlbut family expanded its acreage and output, cultivating fruit orchards, raising animals, and eventually selling their produce, eggs, and poultry to towns across Connecticut. In the early 20th century, a modest roadside market emerged—first a picnic table, then a small gabled stand in 1963—where the community came to gather and enjoy the bounty of the farm.</p><p id="""">In 1980, stewardship of the farm passed to Cathy and Howie Bronson. Cathy, the daughter of Lewis Hurlbut, was born into the farm and raised with hands in the soil. Howie, a native of Washington, CT, brought a background in dairy and formal training from the University of New Hampshire. Together, they grew the farm’s offerings, built greenhouses, and expanded vegetable production, eventually constructing a new farm stand in 1986. Their children, Linnea and Christopher, became the fifth generation raised on the land, continuing the rhythm of seasonal life under the backdrop of Roxbury’s scenic hills, where sheep and cows still graze peacefully behind the stand.</p><p id="""">Today, Maple Bank Farm continues to thrive under the care of Cathy and Howie, alongside the next generation of young farmers like Kirby Peters. With deep roots and a reverence for tradition, the farm offers not only heirloom apples and pick-your-own blueberries but also a timeless experience of pastoral New England. Preserved through partnership with the Weantinoge Land Trust and the State of Connecticut, the land remains protected for future stewards. Maple Bank Farm is not just a place of production, but a legacy of care, community, and continuity—welcoming visitors into its centuries-old embrace.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c278477f52c8d21cc9dae_unnamed.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c2784dd8e8d1baf82c765_unnamed%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c278477f52c8d21cc9db1_unnamed%20(2).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c2784cc8c968bde5dee2e_498839490_18363554140180208_6745943026463901873_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c2784d25dfb5a56b44399_504512550_18362504098180208_4961555155012439723_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c27841abf253d49a1a545_474027727_18345361291180208_2841419319334826923_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c27841e386971b4e9a252_470565572_1020296126804186_5528278654297378488_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c278441fc90042a5f23bc_470727888_1020296130137519_7424960191660777881_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c2784e515d715dfad6ed9_471163364_1020296116804187_340597549437149810_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c2784624df689ff5e3637_469559938_1011322754368190_4108761291089165946_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c27841abf253d49a1a537_467909563_1000678702099262_2533824219044011616_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c278466937bfd02f32172_464576705_18334649692180208_6275382485519941598_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c27865893022642ac2b38_486728036_1094575009376297_2432982536321628479_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c278c2878bc5858789332_470858399_1020296133470852_1003217623941403184_n.jpg,maplebankfarm@gmail.com,(860) 350-0772,"57 Church Street (Route 317), Roxbury, CT 06783",https://maplebankfarm.com/,Tuesday – Sunday: 10:00 a.m. – 5:30 p.m. Monday: Closed Season: April – December,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Heirloom apples</li><li>Blueberries (Pick-Your-Own, July &amp; August)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Corn</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Mixed baby salad greens</li><li>Early season greens</li><li>Other seasonal vegetables</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Animal Products:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Eggs</li><li>Wool (raw and crafted wool goods)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Custom knitted wool stockings</li></ul>",

Since its humble beginnings in 1915, when Thomas and Rose Marchukaitis first tilled its soil with 15 cows and two horses, the farm has flourished into a beloved local destination. Through decades of stewardship and innovation, the March family has grown the property into a vibrant 150-acre enterprise offering not only bountiful produce, but also treasured community experiences.</p><p id="""">In its earliest days, March Farm was a diversified homestead producing milk, poultry, vegetables, and hay. The 1950s brought expansion into fruit with the planting of apple orchards, and by the 1980s, a renewed focus on produce and community engagement emerged. The farm’s commercial kitchen and bakery became local staples, and its greenhouse program expanded to yield an abundance of fresh greens and vegetables well before the field season began. Over the years, pick-your-own options for berries, peaches, apples, and pumpkins became central to the farm's identity, creating opportunities for families to forge connections with the land.</p><p id="""">Today, March Farm remains a cherished gathering place for the community, offering a bounty of seasonal fruits and vegetables, farm-baked treats, and joyous events year-round. From the rustic charm of Pond Side Pines to the panoramic vistas of the Hill Top Orchard, it hosts concerts, yoga, exploration hours, and vibrant CSA programs that deepen the relationship between farmer and eater. Above all, March Farm stands as a living testament to legacy, resilience, and the belief that farming, at its heart, is a labor of love meant to be shared.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d16708fcb67cef15ed_465188574_18332029996195873_6982262398262791882_n.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d1b2915c76d2da0eb8_356427723_655622249927645_2122116063670337444_n.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d190a4edd25d05698f_343406832_3580715845494016_2323043094506405891_n-2-1.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d1c6ec6320e8331459_285822913_1961366557382158_3548848951879774363_n-2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d1ab66668fde6ee1e3_peaches.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d19b81110ca567e9c5_blueberries.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d16dea941c5f5c85e7_march-farm-goats.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d1a02bf77c3ea12313_csa-photo.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d14fc3fa6679148236_8-1.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d1a00ef1a2d15fe9b3_4-1.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d10228fa3d7d12e2d2_Entire-Space-With-Fire_Wide_Edit-scaled.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d086d9788a8c63d238_505434620_18359613262195873_159855914497597168_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d16708fcb67cef15d3_471419087_18339452635195873_4748840226272229046_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d1c6ec6320e8331422_470212323_18337862944195873_2620405245953412815_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1d1a16a1e91012c7d6c_ciderdonut.png,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686ab1c95cd854659e4d13d5_503869805_18358574839195873_131616155447887810_n.jpg,info@marchfarms.com,(203) 266-7721,"160 Munger Lane, Bethlehem, CT 06751",https://marchfarm.com/,Monday–Sunday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (Cortland, Empire, Fuji, Gala, Golden Delicious, Honey Crisp, Jonagold, Macintosh, Macoun, Mutsu, Red Delicious, Rome)</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Plums</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Nectarines</li><li>Cherries</li><li>Melons</li><li>Pumpkins (carving, sugar, stackable)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Tomatoes (Dutch Variety, Cherry)</li><li>Cucumbers (English, Mini)</li><li>Sweet Corn</li><li>Squash (Summer, Winter varieties)</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Salad Greens</li><li>Kale</li><li>Arugula</li><li>Beets</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Onions</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Potatoes</li><li>String Beans</li><li>Sugar Snap Peas</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Basil</li><li>Assorted seasonal herbs</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Baked Goods</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Cider Donuts</li><li>Cookies</li><li>Brownies</li><li>Muffins</li><li>Scones</li><li>Breads</li><li>Pies (including fruit pies)</li><li>Pound Cakes</li><li>Pastries</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry Goods / Specialty Items</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Jams &amp; Jellies</li><li>Maple Syrup</li><li>Honey</li><li>Dressings</li><li>Regional food specialties</li></ul>",

The estate, though private, spans forty acres of meticulously cultivated gardens, vineyards, and fields that produce an impressive array of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers. With a view that stretches to the Berkshire foothills, Maywood’s grounds are both cultivated and conserved — carefully balanced between aesthetic beauty and functional productivity.</p><p id="""">What sets Maywood apart is not only its breathtaking setting and traditional architecture, but its commitment to sustainability and wildlife preservation. The estate employs environmentally sound practices including IPM (Integrated Pest Management), supports birdlife through bluebird trails and berry-producing plantings, and hosts beehives to encourage natural pollination. As members of Audubon International and the first Connecticut property to join the Rainforest Alliance's SmartWood forestry program, Maywood sets a standard for conscientious land management. Their agricultural methods follow guidelines set by the Northeast Organic Farming Association (NOFA), and their products reflect this care: from the rich soil comes fresh produce, maple syrup, honey, and exquisite wines.</p><p id="""">While not open to the public year-round, Maywood opens its gates annually for a single day in August in support of the National Garden Conservancy, welcoming guests to tour the grounds and experience its splendor.

The farm’s roots run deep into Wilton’s history, with the land first purchased by Dr. Vincent Tito in 1911. Since then, Millstone has transformed from a traditional farm into a beacon of innovation and sustainability, evolving with each generation while preserving its pastoral charm.</p><p id="""">Under current stewardship since 2016, Millstone Farm has embraced a holistic approach to land management and food production. Their rotational grazing system integrates sheep, goats, chickens, llamas, and turkeys—each species contributing uniquely to the land's renewal. Their no-till vegetable beds, winter grazing rotations, and use of cover crops further enrich the soil while reducing erosion, pest pressure, and off-farm inputs. With year-round growing through greenhouses and hoop houses, Millstone offers a rich harvest that stretches from early spring into the depths of winter.</p><p id="""">Millstone’s CSA program offers a flexible, credit-based model allowing members to shop at their own pace—be it for vibrant greens, heritage pork, wild-caught Alaskan salmon, or cozy wool goods. More than a farm, Millstone is a deeply rooted community hub where conservation meets culinary celebration. From their equestrian facilities and farmer’s markets to their mission of honoring heritage breeds and stewarding the land, Millstone Farm embodies the essence of “real food, raised right”—a testament to enduring values in a changing world.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a07524a965f8c188b29_millstone-about-02_1738252589.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a07e9634cf3eb977e7e_2025-01-30_11-00-35_1738252841.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a07f96562b2716053d9_2025-01-30_12-29-34_1738258180.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a079982f38944c0d29b_millstone-regfarm-10_1738257396.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a07d395edae3e824fa9_millstone-regfarm-05_1738257396.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a0796bf636ceefaba2f_2025-01-30_12-21-16_1738257684.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a0777a8f882230a6079_millstone-visit-02_1738251030.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a07f3721bd2507bdb6a_millstone-regfarm-09_1738257397.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68781a022e65e6c572d4b069_2025-01-30_10-32-46_1738251187.jpg,info@millstonefarm.org,(203) 834-2605,"180 Millstone Road, Wilton, CT 06897",https://www.millstonefarm.org/,"Farm Stand (April–November): Saturdays, 10:00 AM – 2:00 PM","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Meat</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Heritage breed pork (whole and half shares)</li><li>Pasture-raised chicken (whole broilers)</li><li>Pasture-raised beef (ground beef, burger patties, uncured hot dogs)</li><li>Lamb (seasonal, pasture-raised)</li><li>Thanksgiving turkeys (Broad-Breasted Bronze, pasture-raised)</li><li>Slipstream wild-caught Alaskan Sockeye salmon (available in shares, seasonal)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eggs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Multicolor, pasture-raised chicken eggs (limited, seasonal)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables &amp; Greens</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Lettuce</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Kale</li><li>Mustard greens</li><li>Chard</li><li>Collards</li><li>Endive</li><li>Beets</li><li>Radishes</li><li>String beans</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Tomatoes (including heirlooms)</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Mache</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Microgreens</li><li>Other seasonal offerings (CSA &amp; farm stand)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Value-Added Products</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Chicken bone broth</li><li>Heirloom tomato ketchup</li><li>Sauces &amp; preserves</li><li>Gift baskets</li><li>Wool blankets (Shetland wool)</li><li>Wool socks, gloves (Shetland)</li><li>Leather dog collars (Highland Cattle leather)</li><li>Cow horns and hides (Highland Cattle)</li><li>CSA membership card (farm credit style)</li></ul>",

With a strong vision and deep-rooted commitment to agriculture, the Graniers turned the property into a flourishing fruit orchard that now stands as a testament to intentional stewardship and community-minded farming.</p><p id="""">Over the past two decades, Narrow Lane Orchard has steadily evolved to serve a growing customer base while remaining true to its pastoral charm. The orchard now offers over 20 varieties of fruit, including apples, peaches, nectarines, blueberries, blackberries, and kiwi berries. During the harvest season, guests are invited to pick their own fruit, encouraging a hands-on connection with the land. For added adventure, a mile-long nature trail winds through the property, ending with a quirky photo opportunity beside a life-sized Sasquatch sculpture.</p><p id="""">As much as it is a destination for fresh fruit, Narrow Lane Orchard is also a space where nature, family tradition, and local pride merge. Stephen and Sharon have created more than just a farm—they’ve cultivated a beloved community landmark. From the orchard’s diverse fruit selection to the carefully maintained grounds, every aspect reflects their dedication to offering something meaningful to every visitor.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88ac9fa10160b8a0b3a78_535384058_1187323536756058_2902501349723377237_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88acf329d9e176bf797fe_487240815_1075582597930153_3828147611706030309_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88b0d4fca1911faa50228_471308729_9443443112353986_7615336658351345430_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88b464fde0278072457f2_116344438_3569238533107836_832709627979325624_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88b4bb0b5dcefbd185c7b_117222114_3587580361273653_2134930160219622528_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88b508f6b98b35f5dc1e0_470182957_9387184651313166_1567188569005547642_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88b61aaa9e6d1990baee0_484370189_1064778125677267_2471040826522290095_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68b88b2680e035230d5fe877_504844791_24302665292671857_7881667774549748406_n.jpg,sslagle13@cox.net,(401) 294‑3584,"213 Narrow Lane, North Kingstown, RI 02852",https://www.narrowlaneorchardri.com/,Aug‑Oct daily 10 AM‑5 PM,"<h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li id="""">Apples<ul id=""""><li>Redfree</li><li>Honeycrisp</li><li>Gala</li><li>McIntosh</li><li>Cortland</li><li>Macoun</li><li>Liberty</li><li>Empire</li><li>Cameo</li><li>Braeburn</li><li>Jonagold</li><li>Candy Crisp</li><li>Crispin</li></ul></li><li>Peaches</li><li>Nectarines</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Blackberries</li><li>Kiwi berries</li></ul>",

The farm bridges ancient wisdom and modern science, handcrafting each harvest with precision, sustainability, and love.</p><p id="""">Spencer’s journey began not in agriculture, but in boyhood curiosity. Raised on a mountainside property in New Milford, his childhood was spent exploring the natural world, gathering mosses and newts, unknowingly building the foundation for a lifelong scientific fascination. This passion led him to a degree in Biochemistry and a minor in Biology, where he uncovered the profound interplay between organisms and the ecosystems they inhabit. But it wasn’t until an encounter with a wild reishi mushroom on his family’s land that his path crystallized: fungi were to be his life’s calling.</p><p id="""">Through the solitude of the 2020 lockdowns, Spencer immersed himself fully into mycology, mastering wild foraging, cloning, species-specific cultivation, and the intricate balance of microbial life that sustains mushroom growth. Today, Oracle Mushroom Co. is both a farm and a movement—a dedication to reviving the ancient knowledge of fungi and making it accessible, beautiful, and practical for everyday life. Whether through fine dining menus or local farmers markets, Oracle’s mushrooms are a portal to deeper nourishment, connection, and natural wisdom.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68753484b9f35c78503e9bd5_473042723_17906019873087967_9097283346136239300_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687534848c5bf9c768dcab4e_473812464_122189742416106078_8895847087210480890_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6875348420c6192ab1cffcbe_473678995_122189742638106078_6325639181680676391_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68753484a62a0af38d75137f_473524920_122189742434106078_3045931956105446951_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687534849637bf73e9f8324a_469328880_17901643188087967_4948771384617901464_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/687534843c13defd6e0fa2f8_441638490_17874745572087967_4307729075270074941_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68753484d5f2c7c5c8d04e78_470178066_122184961562106078_3343708726338780787_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6875348469fedfc9366ea787_473610968_122189742368106078_5599217610616628777_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6875347e07a3227b223ade65_473583506_122189638142106078_7320233933013269730_n.jpg,spencer@oraclemushrooms.com,(475) 867-3191,"110 Treasure Hill Rd, South Kent, CT 06785",https://www.oraclemushrooms.com/,,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Mushrooms</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Lion’s Mane</li><li id="""">Deep Blue Oyster Mushrooms</li><li id="""">Golden Oyster Mushrooms</li><li id="""">Chestnut Mushrooms</li><li id="""">King Oyster Mushrooms</li><li id="""">Seasonal mushroom varieties</li></ul>",

Founded by Mark Maynard, the farm grew from a mission rooted in health and integrity: to provide hormone- and antibiotic-free meat and produce to local communities. Drawing from over three decades of experience in beef farming, Mark cultivated a model grounded in conservation, rotational grazing, and self-reliance—growing their own feed, managing pastures holistically, and adhering to regenerative soil practices.</p><p id="""">The farm's ethos is simple but resolute: local, natural, and honest. Mark and his partner Stephanie personally manage every detail, ensuring that all animals are raised humanely, seasonally pastured, and nourished on the farm’s own Non-GMO grains and hay. Their Angus beef, Berkshire pork, free-range chicken, and Dorper lamb reflect not just high-quality cuts but a commitment to soil, animal, and human health. In the colder months, animals are kept in open shelters with ample space, maintaining their comfort and well-being year-round.</p><p id="""">Beyond livestock, Ox Hollow cultivates 23 acres of vibrant vegetable gardens using organic, Non-GMO seeds. With minimal spraying, hand-tended soil, and compost from their animals, every crop reflects the same care found in their meats. Their CSA program, farm stands, and regular presence at Connecticut and New York farmers markets embody their belief that fresh, local food should be accessible and trustworthy. Ox Hollow Farm is not just a place—it’s a promise kept, season after season.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683cf2cb7d79944cfdb22383_55cbef9d184cc499675fbefa623cdf44.jpg;

The Suffield property has belonged to the Griffin family since the mid-1800s, tracing back to ancestors who emigrated from Northern Ireland. The East Granby parcel, used for most crop production, sits on land originally granted by the King of England in 1647—making the farm a living piece of colonial and agricultural history. Today, the 11th generation of the Griffin family carries forward this legacy with a commitment to sustainability, health, and community.</p><p id="""">Originally launched as a CSA-focused operation in 2009, Oxen Hill Farm quickly became known for its diverse organic vegetable shares and vibrant, pick-your-own flower fields. The farm’s name pays tribute to “Spike and Tony,” two beloved oxen who once lived on the Suffield property, symbolizing strength, heritage, and the land’s enduring character. Each season, CSA members receive highly customizable shares and gain access to fields of fresh herbs and cherry tomatoes, strengthening the direct connection between farmer and consumer. Through these relationships, Oxen Hill not only feeds but nurtures a regional community of health-conscious families.</p><p id="""">Their organic farming practices go well beyond USDA requirements. Every year, they undergo detailed inspections, record-keeping, and audits through Baystate Organic Certifiers. Now in their 14th year of certification and 17th year of organic management, the team at Oxen Hill stands as a model for transparency and ecological stewardship. More than a business, the farm is a lifestyle—one rooted in integrity, education, and shared abundance.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b7e089266cccd39adcc10_495670704_1227804626016149_6963417790975859003_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b7e08cdebe0a37a85e641_494045728_1219569850172960_5350593494573108947_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b7e08bcfc50b6b619d099_499587364_1237959131667365_1225630619301255199_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981b978fcd7ee4331751_IMG_0030_Original-1024x613.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981ccd8fe3c5ba0b3732_Screenshot-2024-04-01-at-5.41.06-PM-1024x679.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981bcb9ea083f227c6d2_Screenshot-2024-04-01-at-5.40.57-PM-1024x764.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981b7c5267c8b697422c_Screenshot-2024-03-31-at-7.47.36-PM-1024x665.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981be9f8fcb341550609_Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-4.31.37-PM-1024x670.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981be9f8fcb3415505f6_Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-6.12.39-PM-1-1024x664.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981b7c5267c8b697421f_Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-11.19.52-PM-2-1024x674.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981b51856406d6079c32_Screenshot-2024-03-31-at-7.30.11-PM-1024x681.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981b70aaab3811e39082_Screenshot-2024-03-31-at-7.46.12-PM-1024x673.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981af9c742047343b84e_Screenshot-2024-03-31-at-7.27.30-PM-1024x677.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981bca0a0ddd3dae5b79_Screenshot-2024-03-31-at-8.03.29-PM-1024x673.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981bfc75e080b886127d_Screenshot-2024-03-31-at-7.39.18-PM-1024x675.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981b7c5267c8b6974202_Screenshot-2024-03-31-at-8.13.13-PM-1024x665.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b981aa3cb5280b4768284_494968371_1290237609498644_3254607932276280584_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9815e0b90cfb6bad23ec_75336413_1316291401894390_7704456350113202176_n.jpg,flowers@oxenhillfarm.com,(860) 214-5104,"1434 Hill Street, Suffield, CT 06078",https://oxenhillfarm.com/,"Tues & Thurs 2:00–6:30 PM, Sat 9:00 AM–12:00 PM","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Certified Organic Vegetables (CSA – Seasonal Variety)</strong><br>– Lettuce<br>– Kale<br>– Chard<br>– Radishes<br>– Salad Turnips<br>– Summer Squash<br>– Broccoli<br>– Beans<br>– Cabbage<br>– Cucumbers<br>– Peppers (green and colored)<br>– Eggplant<br>– Sweet Corn<br>– Tomatoes (various types)<br>– Potatoes<br>– Winter Squash<br>– Sweet Potatoes<br>– Late-Season Greens<br>– Roots and Storage Crops</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Melons</strong><br>– Various types (seasonally included in CSA shares)</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers (Non-Certified)</strong><br>– Bouquet Shares (8 weeks)<br>– Pick-Your-Own (herbs and flowers at Suffield location)<br>– Custom Bouquets (available by request via email)</p><p>‍</p>",

Set along the scenic Oronoque Road, the farm has become a local hub for fresh produce and shared values, inviting neighbors to be part of something seasonal, rooted, and real. Its engagement through greenhouse sales and participation in the Downtown Milford Farmers’ Market highlights a mission-driven effort to bring farm-fresh offerings directly to the community.</p><p id="""">Seasonal rhythm defines life at River Crest Farm. As summer arrives, the greenhouse opens its doors on Sundays, offering a selection of homegrown plants and vegetables.

This demand illustrates a powerful local trust in the farm’s quality, transparency, and authenticity.</p><p id="""">Conservation and environmental responsibility are woven into the daily operations at River Crest. One notable example: the farm’s initiative to collect and reuse plant pots—a small but meaningful effort to reduce waste and promote circularity in agriculture. Though they've currently paused this practice due to overwhelming community participation, they're quick to direct supporters to other recycling avenues. More than just a provider of food, River Crest Farm cultivates a culture of care—for land, for people, and for the possibilities that grow between them.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d20ce7deb856cccc7d8a0_2013-05-26%2B12.38.27.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d20d8112f51d278f03d99_2013-05-26%2B12.58.32.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d20df8e565c5695c5b9f8_image-asset.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d20e22dc3f0cdb3bec344_aboutus_03.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d20ef114bb08733130a7e_veg2.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d20feed5de26a2b036fe4_IMG_6028.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d210c643a3d26d87f84c3_D2EEFE41-F2BE-4F22-AB16-65A71266B103.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d217dbba1d86ad32a9b16_509426862_10163443915576660_8376624824989078140_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d218babcb5db8c5e094b1_508974901_10163426160376660_4606929863953902118_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d21abc87316b124021086_482222979_10162941637821660_7574722456965892781_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/688d21bed965015d4e1a14ee_194375464_10159531990291660_4534654362363582584_n.jpg,rivercrestfarm@gmail.com,—,"534 Oronoque Rd, Milford, CT 06461",rivercrestfarm.com,Greenhouse open Sun 1 PM–4 PM,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Lettuce</li><li id="""">Radishes</li><li id="""">Greens</li><li id="""">Pea pods</li><li id="""">Garlic</li><li id="""">Beets</li><li id="""">Onions</li><li id="""">Kohlrabi</li><li id="""">Beans</li><li id="""">Carrots</li><li id="""">Eggplant</li><li id="""">Tomatoes</li><li id="""">Peppers</li><li id="""">Winter squash</li><li id="""">Popcorn</li><li id="""">Kale</li><li id="""">Pumpkins</li><li id="""">Swiss chard</li><li id="""">Collards</li><li id="""">Cherry tomatoes</li><li id="""">Malabar spinach</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Blueberries</li><li id="""">Raspberries</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Culinary herbs</li><li id="""">Medicinal herbs</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Flowers</li><li id="""">Annuals</li><li id="""">Perennials</li><li id="""">Native plants</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry/Other</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Vegetable starts</li><li id="""">Houseplants</li><li id="""">Cacti</li><li id="""">Succulents</li></ul><p><strong>Eggs</strong></p>",

Over the centuries, this fertile land has nurtured generations of farming families who once raised dairy cows and cultivated essential crops.

David’s journey to the farm began in 1989 when, initially captivated by the land's beauty while intending to pursue carpentry, he planted his first modest half-acre garden. By 1991, his passion had blossomed into full-time farming. Laura, who joined David after their serendipitous meeting during a produce delivery in the summer of 1996, brought with her deep agricultural knowledge and a shared enthusiasm for sustainable living. Together, the couple has weathered countless challenges—harsh weather, wildlife incursions, and long, demanding days—to establish a flourishing, resilient farm that reflects their profound love for the earth and each other.</p><p id="""">Beyond cultivating crops, David and Laura have created the Riverbank Farm Kitchen, an innovative culinary endeavor that transforms their fresh harvests into delicious vegetarian dishes and fermented specialties. Their commitment to sustainable agriculture also extends to nurturing future farmers through a comprehensive apprenticeship program, equipping enthusiastic learners with the skills needed to run their own sustainable market gardens. David and Laura firmly believe that the bounty of Riverbank Farm nourishes not only the body but also fosters a deep, lasting connection to the land.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d51b2df8fd11a6004_IMG_4151%2Bcopy.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d6052385f1817703d_IMG_1121.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d788e8f7f0cb3956b_DSC02064.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5e71e7854657d6a240_image-asset%20(1).png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5dc0015ea6a495ae26_IMG_1092.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d85cc62493a9d0fab_IMG_1094.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d503a6c547db6d5bc_IMG_1096.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d4f2313f12e475a3b_IMG_1431.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d6696c7f91175cb41_IMG_0663.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d1c13fb0410336bd5_DSCN0408.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d10d9d53e2fecfc73_image-asset.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d95bf171478f4f846_IMG_1126.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5da4dfece60813f0ec_IMG_1140.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5dfea0b5061b1a8d0b_IMG_1148.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5de025330743536519_IMG_1209.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d34fd2c5e22ea3733_IMG_1618.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5d1c13fb0410336bb8_lily%2Band%2Balice%2B2008%2B078.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c5dba5dcb44e62bc443_IMG_3774.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5d05d79711f1799b0927_IMG_1662.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685c5c59d6f08ac3b01f7944_image-asset.png,riverbankfarmct@yahoo.com,860-350-3276,"33 River Road Roxbury, CT 06783",https://www.riverbankfarm.com/,"Farmers Markets: Westport, Darien, Greenwich, Old Greenwich, New Canaan, New Milford, New Haven Edgewood Park; Westport Winter Market, Wooster Square Winter Market; Available at Stores and Restaurants: New Morning Natural Store, Woodbury, CT","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Arugula</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Beans</li><li>Sugar snap peas</li><li>Beets</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Salad mix</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Onions</li><li>Winter squash</li><li>Sweet and hot peppers</li><li>Cherry, beefsteak, and heirloom tomatoes</li><li>Eggplant</li><li>Watermelons &amp; cantaloupe</li><li>Leeks</li><li>Radishes</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Kale</li><li>Swiss chard</li><li>Zucchini</li><li>Summer squash</li><li>Turnips</li><li>Celeriac</li><li>Cucumbers</li><li>Pumpkins &amp; winter squash</li><li>Shallots</li><li>Potatoes (gold, red, blue, fingerling)</li><li>Sweet potatoes</li><li>Parsnips</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Strawberries</li><li>Apples (small orchard on-site)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Assorted herbs (specific types not listed)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Organically grown cut flowers</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Prepared Foods (Riverbank Farm Kitchen):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Vegetarian soups</li><li>Salads</li><li>Hummus</li><li>Pestos</li><li id="""">Fermented products:<ul id=""""><li>Pickles</li><li>Ginger carrots</li><li>Salsa</li><li>Kimchi</li><li>Sauerkraut</li></ul></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other Products:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Honey (from on-site honeybees)</li><li>Hay</li></ul>",

What began with Chauncey Merriman—a Revolutionary War veteran and early settler—has blossomed over eight generations into a thriving orchard that bridges heritage and innovation. His legacy was built on a deep connection to the land, and that ethos has been passed through centuries of family stewardship. From the early days of planting apple trees along Shuttle Meadow Lake to today’s ecologically certified practices, Rogers Orchards has remained steadfast in its commitment to cultivating wholesome, locally grown fruit.</p><p id="""">The spirit of ingenuity has long defined the Rogers-Merriman family. From “Old Pickles” and his thousand Baldwin apple trees to Elijah Rogers’ bold decision to plant thousands of peach trees in Connecticut soil, each generation has dared to try something new. In the 20th century, Harold Rogers experimented with automated vending for apples, while his son “Bud” expanded the farm’s reach through a pioneering electric farm store. John Rogers built the bakery that now draws loyal customers year-round, and today, the family continues to evolve under the leadership of Peter Rogers, Greg Parzych, and Jeff Rogers—who returned home to launch Long View Ciderhouse, a small-batch cider operation that uses only fruit grown on the family’s land.</p><p id="""">Now spanning 275 acres and offering over 20 apple varieties and 15 kinds of peaches, Rogers Orchards is not only a place to pick your own fruit, but a true cultural and agricultural institution. Its farm stands brim with orchard-fresh produce, fragrant baked goods, local delicacies, and beautifully curated gift baskets. As a proud Eco Apple® and Eco Peach™ grower, the farm leads with a whole-systems ecological approach that supports pollinators, biodiversity, and the long-term health of the land. More than just a family business, Rogers Orchards is a living story—of seasonal rhythms, community ties, and an enduring dedication to nourishing both land and neighbor.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f880b485a83bf0de46c_shuttle-meadow-farm.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8801c79538277da018_orchard_location.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f88ecbbccb35070bc7d_orchard-apple-picking.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f886a1afabe1dc4527e_Truck.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8836e81aa60e641334_Bottles-Variety_.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f88683438882d3709ff_Copy-of-DON-ANDY.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f88eccc7db395ce8908_Copy-of-full-timers-1.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8890a8e97efd5d27f7_469355107_18366263125190115_1729392431007116135_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8883224671502dbf08_469447000_18366263155190115_3972823962545744594_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f878891211d5ade3f27_488615641_1213512807312589_5570647452891681478_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8713f93019f34d4569_488943001_1213716677292202_675289417339580181_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f875334e91374706e12_488937092_1212387817425088_1574837691632336057_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8773574079071f9cdd_488933083_1211773317486538_8742833269463732154_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f87c8d9b12af783c829_488613343_1211557220841481_4297833870601541336_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f879f1350871beba7f8_475547908_1157856619544875_4733947610510621076_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f87db6a0056e4ff1554_488358733_9753029118081559_833673965913754764_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8759da870e33ae49dc_484176688_9630893720295100_5104263276874785816_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f8713f93019f34d4528_464692499_8835906673127146_7793007395304548859_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f876d09ac5882336ae5_463368939_8762752733775874_7761621218285274111_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68531f7bacaa7bb0c659262a_477451568_1165639098766627_2349711959820448386_n.jpg,fruit@rogersorchards.com,Sunnymount Farm: (203) 879-1206 Shuttle Meadow Farm: (860) 229-4240,"Sunnymount Farm: 2876 Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike, Southington, CT 06489 Shuttle Meadow Farm: 336 Long Bottom Rd, Southington, CT 06489 Cider Truck: 36 Long Bottom Rd, Southington, CT 06489",https://rogersorchards.com/,"Farm Stores: 7 days a week, 9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Bottle Shop: 7 days a week, 10:00 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (20 varieties, including McIntosh, Honeycrisp, Gala, Empire, Macoun, Cortland, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Cameo, Pink Lady, Evercrisp)</li><li>Peaches (15 varieties)</li><li>Nectarines</li><li>Apricots</li><li>Plums</li><li>Pumpkins</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Corn (from Wethersfield)</li><li>Summer squash</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Cucumbers</li><li>Green beans</li><li>Wax beans</li><li>Peppers</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Baked Goods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apple cider donuts (daily)</li><li>Apple fritter donuts (weekends)</li><li>Fruit pies (10” and 6”)</li><li>Apple dumplings</li><li>Coffee cakes</li><li>Cookies</li><li>Scones</li><li>Tea breads</li><li>Donut holes (seasonal varieties)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Dairy &amp; Protein:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Local milk</li><li>Artisanal cheeses</li><li>Farm-fresh eggs</li><li>Locally produced bacon</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry &amp; Specialty Items:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Local honey</li><li>CT maple syrup</li><li>Farm-made preserves</li><li>Granola</li><li>Freshly baked bread (delivered daily)</li><li>Local ice cream</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Beverages:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Hard cider (Long View Ciderhouse)</li><li>Fresh apple cider</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Gift Baskets (Customizable):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fancy fruit baskets (apples, pears, citrus)</li><li>Apples ’n Cheese (adds cheddar)</li><li>Connecticut Yankee (adds cheddar + preserves)</li><li>New Englander (adds CT honey + preserves)</li><li>Bountiful Harvest (adds cheddar, maple syrup, CT honey)</li></ul>",

Their vision carries the legacy of the Roses forward, balancing reverence for the past with an unshakable hope for a greener future.

Now stewarded by the fifth generation of the Epstein family, Rosedale is far more than a farm—it is a living, breathing celebration of seasonal abundance, culinary heritage, and community connection.</p><p>Across the farm’s vibrant acreage, you’ll find a dazzling array of just-picked produce: sun-warmed heirloom tomatoes, fragrant basil, golden sweet corn, heritage apples, vine-ripened melons, and the kind of grapes that still carry the memory of the soil. These ingredients don’t just feed— they elevate. The farm’s produce is beloved by top local chefs and found in celebrated dishes across Connecticut.</p><p>Rosedale’s award-winning vineyard brings even more to the table, with over a dozen handcrafted wines—from dry whites and bold reds to playful rosés and subtly sweet blends—each made with estate or regionally sourced grapes and the same care that defines everything grown here. Tastings, flights, and weekend wine-by-the-glass events make the vineyard a destination in itself, while a scratch bakery and farm store round out the experience with pies, preserves, and carefully curated local goods.</p><p>Beyond its daily offerings, Rosedale is also home to beloved seasonal traditions: sunflower strolls, corn mazes, farm fests, live music, and elegant Chef-to-Farm dinners in partnership with Max Hospitality. It’s a place where weddings unfold under a canopy of grapevines, families pick raspberries in the summer sun, and every visit becomes a story worth remembering.</p><p>At Rosedale, every apple, every bottle, every bloom carries the imprint of time, tradition, and a family’s enduring devotion to the land.

The land itself carries echoes of the past, once home to a Finnish chicken farm in the 1930s with its now-rare two-story coop still standing. Since 2015, farmers James Russo and Libby Tarleton have been transforming rocky pastures into thriving fields teeming with organic vegetables, restoring the soil through composting, cover cropping, and regenerative practices to breathe new life into old land.</p><p id="""">James Russo is a first-generation farmer whose passion for growing began in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts and carried him through years of experience across the Hudson Valley and Long Island. There, he co-managed a 65-acre CSA feeding over 2,000 members. Libby, too, found her calling in agriculture after college, first working in vegetable fields, then among the ordered rows of Long Island vineyards. When the time came to build something of their own, they returned to vegetables—and to Connecticut—with a shared vision rooted in sustainability, flavor, and community.</p><p id="""">Now in their tenth growing season, Russo’s Roots offers a wide range of Certified Organic vegetables—from everyday staples like carrots and tomatoes to adventurous offerings like ginger, red napa cabbage, and puntarelle. Through a popular CSA program, a vibrant farm stand, and a loyal presence at the Willimantic Farmers Market, the farm nourishes both body and soul. James and Libby’s thoughtful cultivation methods and deep reverence for the land result in produce that is not only beautiful and delicious, but truly restorative—for the eater, the soil, and the spirit of local farming.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895230e68519c0a0e6f17af_463790675_18426112858078025_1405247322280476958_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68952314a11041d5dda54ece_463381451_18426112882078025_1857023046284241803_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895231e36493a854441f088_463915755_18426112849078025_5780964788593379707_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895232200b3c2ceae065a68_472957263_18440927701078025_2138579934707783331_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895235221e96505764b96c6_485800729_3944937805793538_3215420832551982841_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895235ad730f3824db3b18e_485706877_3943023382651647_7694271528458484357_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895235e7099f5769748f805_485783148_3942837542670231_8487599536112898710_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895236c203149018c6f7a72_182718387_2905519763068686_2397078735095539029_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895238d37faca94d60e5cbb_493744788_3982469352040383_2557458467923839732_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/689523945bbc6a22f700bad3_494055197_3980222108931774_2665897646936519284_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6895244f4a9916bcea649498_unnamed%20(2).webp,russosroots@gmail.com,(860)-556-9325,"289 North Society Road, Canterbury, CT",https://www.russosroots.com/,Farm Stand Open: 9am-1pm on weekends,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Arugula</li><li>Asparagus</li><li>Beets</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Brussels sprouts</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Chinese greens</li><li>Collards</li><li>Cucumber</li><li>Eggplant</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Green beans</li><li>Green onions</li><li>Hot peppers</li><li>Kale</li><li>Kohlrabi</li><li>Leeks</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Mustard greens</li><li>Onions</li><li>Parsnips</li><li>Potatoes</li><li>Radishes</li><li>Rutabagas</li><li>Salad greens</li><li>Salad mix</li><li>Shallots</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Summer squash</li><li>Sweet peppers</li><li>Sweet potatoes</li><li>Swiss chard</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Turnips</li><li>Winter squash</li><li>Zucchini</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Rhubarb</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Cantaloupes</li><li>Watermelons</li><li>Raspberries</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh herbs</li><li>Ginger</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry/Other</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Mushroom Shares (CSA Add-on)</li><li>Flower Shares (CSA Add-on, seasonal)</li><li>Honey Share (CSA Add-on, seasonal)</li></ul>",

Located in Salisbury, Connecticut, the farm began when a family stumbled upon a historic homestead with bricks made from Salmon Kill Creek silt. What followed was an unhurried, beautiful unfolding—a daughter organizing the purchase of donkeys at age ten, goats introduced to manage invasive plants, chickens arriving years later, and an orchard planted with hopes bees might one day arrive. In time, bees did come—via their own apiary—and the once quiet plot grew into a certified organic and Certified Humane farm known for its award-winning honey, rainbow-hued eggs, and garden-to-pantry seasonal offerings.</p><p id="""">Every product from Salmon Kill Farm reflects an intentional choice. Their honey is raw and unpasteurized, preserving the floral complexity of the native wildflowers, clover, fruit trees, and herbs that the bees forage on. Their chickens roam freely, live long, healthy lives, and produce marigold-yolked eggs in a kaleidoscope of colors—ivory, blue, green, brown, peach—each one unique. Their orchard and garden yield a mix of classic and uncommon fruits and vegetables, which they transform into small-batch chutneys, jams, and hot sauces. Everything is grown with care, harvested with reverence, and made with the simplest, purest ingredients.</p><p id="""">Salmon Kill Farm is more than just a farm—it’s a statement.

The farm’s honor system store, open daily from 7 to 7, offers a nostalgic, self-serve experience filled with everything from hand-bottled cream-line milk and rich gelato to pasture-raised meats and eggs—all produced on-site with an old-world charm and modern ethical standards.</p><p id="""">Shaggy Coos is more than a farm—it is a deeply personal mission to produce traceable, nutrient-rich food for future generations.

A New York City native with a passion for gardening, Ben moved to Connecticut as a young man and eventually saved enough to purchase his first parcel of land on Sport Hill Road. His initial endeavor was a cider mill—one that became a local staple for over six decades. Ben lived modestly on the farm, slowly expanding the property and raising a family while building a reputation for hard work and agricultural excellence.</p><p id="""">Through the mid-20th century, Silverman’s Farm flourished as a classic “truck farm,” growing a vast array of fruits and vegetables for local families who preserved them for the long New England winters. Ben and his wife Rose raised eight children, and their youngest son, Irv, grew especially passionate about fruit production. Irv took over the farm in the 1970s and ushered in a new era, transforming the property into a pick-your-own orchard and agritourism destination. Scenic tractor rides, a charming petting zoo, and educational school tours turned the farm into a seasonal tradition for countless Connecticut families.</p><p id="""">Today, Silverman’s is still proudly operated by Irv and his extended family, who continue to blend heritage and hospitality into every corner of the farm. From rows of heirloom apples to bustling farm markets and whimsical animal enclosures, Silverman’s offers the quintessential farm experience. Generations of visitors return each year not just for the produce or pies, but for the sense of warmth and nostalgia that only a farm like this can provide. It is a living testament to a century of care, rooted in the Silverman family’s love for land, food, and community.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e80db9954ad26c74594_silvermans-animal-farm-01.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e8053bb7e84ff565020_ct-farm-peaches-01.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e802bca98b74214d94d_ct-farm-blueberries-01.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7f152a839310e8eb87_ct-apple-orchard-flowers-01.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e80f07572331d80950e_silvermans-20170913-048.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e8072ccdab3a1505455_silvermans-20170913-003.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7fd5f14b9084a9cacf_silvermans-20170913-090-e1526656351743.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7f72ccdab3a150542d_pyo-11-scaled.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7f7910ec4640ca5036_452847274_18438022348068133_1028757859691966810_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7fd9d0a0d9a44ed8e6_469354450_18462617788068133_6927723327096943421_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7e026152d89bb33b9d_482264762_1055321876629502_9133465910936897015_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7f43eb3168716910ce_482024837_4120055081651381_8410215347613894198_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7fcbfd675cf84ccd3d_481001267_4109661222690767_574462461884144925_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7f915bdb5272ffb561_481701756_4112652642391625_4369676008821510191_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e7ef8652a117c00c1d8_515135453_18499707700068133_1842842151491057571_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68790e5d9ba0b52b837d4ad7_ct-apple-picking-aerial-01.jpg,groups@silvermansfarm.com,(203) 261-3306,"451 Sport Hill Road, Easton, CT 06612",https://www.silvermansfarm.com/,"Farm Market: Open daily, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM (March 1 – December 31) Animal Farm: Open daily, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM (weather permitting) Pick Your Own: 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM, when in season","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit (Pick Your Own &amp; Market)</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (Ginger Gold, Gala Red, MacIntosh, Cortland, Empire, Macoun, Honey Crisp, Crimson Crisp, Red &amp; Golden Delicious, Mutsu, Jonagold, Autumn Gala, Ida Red, Northern Spy, Red Rome, Cameo, Sun Crisp, Red Winesap, Enterprise, Fuji, Pink Lady)</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Raspberries</li><li>Plums</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables (Market Fresh, Seasonal)</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Lettuce</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Potatoes</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Onions</li><li>Beets</li><li>Eggplant</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Bakery &amp; Specialty Items</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh-baked pies (up to 16 varieties including Apple, Dutch Apple, Peach, Pumpkin, Blueberry, Pecan, Coconut Custard, Strawberry Rhubarb, and more)</li><li>Apple cider donuts</li><li>Apple cider (pressed from Silverman’s own apples, no added sugar)</li><li>Farm-baked cookies and desserts</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Dairy &amp; Eggs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Milk</li><li>Eggs</li><li>Cheese</li><li>Specialty cheese spreads</li><li>Fresh bread</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry &amp; Gift Items</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Jams, jellies, preserves</li><li>Pickles, condiments, sauces</li><li>Local honey</li><li>Maple syrup</li><li>Stonewall Kitchen products</li><li>Country gifts, greeting cards, and collectibles</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Plants</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Seasonal annuals and perennials</li><li>Choice combination baskets</li><li>Greenhouse gift plants</li></ul>",

For nearly a century, the Smyth family has tended this land with devotion, evolving it from a humble Depression-era farmstead into a fully integrated dairy where milk is still bottled on-site. There are no tanker trucks here. Every drop of milk, every carton of yogurt, and every round of butter begins and ends its journey on the farm. That uncompromising commitment to quality and transparency has earned Smyth’s Trinity Farm deep respect throughout the region—including the 2016 Green Pastures Award, naming it Connecticut’s Dairy Farm of the Year.</p><p id="""">At the heart of the farm is a family whose roots run deep in both the soil and the community. Today, the third generation—siblings Anne Dugas and Sam Smyth—lead the day-to-day operations with vision and vitality. Anne, who manages the farm and herd, represents a new era of women in agriculture, supported by her husband Jeremy and their children, who are already active in 4-H and FFA. Sam oversees wholesale and home delivery logistics, and also manages over 70 acres of hay to feed the farm’s grass-fed, pasture-raised cows. Together with their parents, Mike and Dale Smyth, who built the farm’s processing facility in the 1990s, they carry on a legacy of stewardship that blends tradition with thoughtful innovation.</p><p id="""">Smyth’s Trinity Farm is more than a place to buy milk—it is a living system of care, community, and connection. The farm's “Milk and More Store” welcomes locals six days a week, while the home delivery service brings fresh milk, yogurt, and eggs to families across north-central Connecticut and western Massachusetts. Customers also find them at farmers’ markets in Ellington, Springfield, and New Haven. Whether it’s a bottle of rich, creamy milk or a dozen farm-fresh eggs, each product reflects a quiet excellence that comes only from knowing—and loving—every step of the process.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6853242614a4614de0727905_cowsinpasture.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685324269438b271fbbc8b52_52762385_2675785895771535_7755437641981493248_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68532426531f4270c6a5e82f_86343591_3425109514172499_4004966384005021696_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6853242652601d004c7fb675_188697384_4755625874454183_3843048083492438637_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6853247afc07fc92185f33f2_smyth-trinity-farm-website.jpg2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68532426dd30471b68b87e8e_Trinity-Farm-Enfield-CT-NEDC_083016-8450-2-740x490.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6853247a8076c7a2e9dc166b_smyth-trinity-farm-website.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68532421087ad92e25c5c8ff_466917993_9632228230127232_3142710642778871672_n.jpg,sam@smythstrinityfarm.com,(860) 745-0751,"4 Oliver Road, Enfield, CT 06082",https://www.smythstrinityfarm.online/,Monday–Friday: 6:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. Saturday: 6:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m.,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Dairy Products:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Milk (Half-gallons and quarts):</strong><ul id=""""><li>Whole</li><li>1%</li><li>Skim</li><li>Chocolate</li><li>Coffee</li><li>Strawberry</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Premium Yogurt (varieties):</strong><ul id=""""><li>Vanilla</li><li>Plain</li><li>Cherry</li><li>Blueberry</li><li>Raspberry</li><li>Peach</li><li>Lemon</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Butter:</strong><ul id=""""><li>Salted</li><li>Unsalted</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cream:</strong><ul id=""""><li>Half &amp; Half (pts, qts)</li><li>Heavy Cream (pts, qts)</li></ul></li><li><strong id="""">Kefir and Cheese</strong> <em id="""">(sold at store, noted in bio but not listed on board)</em></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Baked Goods (from Luanne’s Bakery):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Chocolate Chip Cookies</li><li>Peanut Butter Cookies</li><li>Snickerdoodle Cookies</li><li>Vanilla Sugar Cookies</li><li>Oatmeal Raisin Cookies<br>(Available by the dozen)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other Items:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Honey (½ lb, 1 lb, 2 lb)</li><li>Eggs (1 dozen)</li></ul>",

The farm is operated by Mark, affectionately known as “The Farmer,” and Susanne, his wife, who describes herself as a farmer, herbalist, educator, and mother. After Mark's military service, the couple began farming to supplement their own food supply, leasing land they still work today. Over the years, their labor of love has grown into a robust operation serving their local community through CSA shares, farmers markets, and direct retail.</p><p id="""">Guided by what Susanne calls a “Minimalistic-Alternative” approach, the farm champions non-GMO agriculture, avoids harsh chemicals, and favors soil health as the foundation for healthy produce. Their philosophy is simple but profound: healthy soil yields healthy plants, which in turn nourish healthy people. This integrity is reflected in their transparent farming practices and personal interactions with customers. Every vegetable is grown with care, and every customer interaction is treated as a moment of shared connection and education.</p><p id="""">The family’s CSA program is not only generous and flexible but deeply personal. Rather than pre-packaged boxes, members choose their produce directly from the farm’s market tables, empowering them to select what they love and learn about new items. This market-style CSA runs from July through November and includes full, half, and fall share options. Susanne also uses the platform to share recipes, herbal knowledge, and reflections on homeschooling and parenting, making Stefan Farms feel more like a movement than just a farm. It's no surprise many customers describe the experience as nourishing both body and soul.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb37a9689e97d5b5afa_484374952_1035574365284847_7886514445698175942_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb378bfb92194878c18_469189976_1540418569968152_5674277471717318019_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb3fc75e080b887f7e8_70038977_385578235452197_229779766788489216_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb327d44bc11e50f586_469258910_1540405323302810_3045572537848398160_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb3e0b90cfb6baf493b_69010319_374564773220210_526389546825285632_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb327d44bc11e50f590_68771874_374564566553564_5498568233583640576_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb3a17b559566b67754_Our%2BFarmer%27s%2BMarket.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb37a9689e97d5b5ad4_Lucy%2BCSA%2B4%2Bsharing.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb3a804e6cddf6f4fba_Mixed%2BHot%2BPepper%2Bcrate%2BSchotch%2BBonnet%2BCherry%2BBomb.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683b9cb3ccc2f9f597388d0d_484923453_1036297605212523_4664528297635239201_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba4d8774ed8e134b30182_susanne-the-farmers-wife.jpg,susanne@stefanfarms.org,(860) 527-5523,"251 Matianuck Ave, Windsor, CT 06095",http://www.stefanfarms.org/,July–October: Thursdays 3–6 PM & Saturdays 12–3 PM November: Saturdays 12–3 PM,"<li>Summer/yellow squash</li><li>Golden and green zucchini</li><li>Pickling cucumbers and fresh cucumbers</li><li>Lettuce</li><li>Butter, sugar, and white corn</li><li>Green beans, wax beans, and experimental bean varieties</li><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Bell, sweet, frying, hot, and extra-hot peppers</li><li>Herbs: basil, dill, cilantro, oregano, thyme, sage, and more</li><li>Beets</li><li>Radishes</li><li>Green and red cabbage</li><li>Eggplant</li><li>Kale</li><li>Collard greens</li><li>Watermelons</li><li>Cantaloupes</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Winter squash (including spaghetti, butternut, stripetti, longneck, and super-sized)</li><li>Pumpkins and munchkins</li><li>Sweet potatoes</li><li>Red and white potatoes</li><li>Yellow, red, and white onions</li><li>Garlic and garlic scapes</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Kohlrabi</li><li>Turnips</li>",

Owned by Fred and Stacia Monahan, the farm began as a roadside vegetable stand in Shelton, CT, and has grown into a full-scale, multi-generational operation offering everything from pasture-raised meats and fresh produce to prepared meals and grocery staples. The Monahans’ journey began in 1996, when they met working at neighboring farms. By 1998, newly married and full of ambition, they started Stone Gardens Farm with just a few acres and a shared vision of raising livestock and vegetables without the demands of industrial dairy life.</p><p id="""">Their dream has evolved into a vibrant farm ecosystem, where each member of the Monahan family plays a role. Tommy, their oldest son, is a USDA-certified butcher who processes all meats onsite. Billy, their middle child, is a skilled welder who maintains farm machinery, and their daughter Sophie tends to the flowers, feeds the animals, and helps with the harvest. Beyond the immediate family, the farm is supported by a deeply connected network of friends, relatives, and community members, many of whom have worked on the farm through personal ties. This network brings a genuine sense of warmth and continuity to every aspect of their work.</p><p id="""">Today, Stone Gardens Farm Market stands proudly in Huntington Center, offering a thoughtfully curated blend of farm-raised meats, seasonal produce, prepared dishes, pantry goods, and products from other local farms.

Nearly a century later, the family continues to farm with profound integrity across 800 acres of preserved land spanning New Milford, Bridgewater, and Roxbury. With a steadfast commitment to regenerative agriculture, they raise grass-fed, grass-finished Red Angus cattle, pastured Freedom Ranger chickens, and heritage-breed pork with humane, holistic care at the center of every practice.</p><p id="""">The farm is proudly Animal Welfare Approved and was the first independent family farm in Connecticut to earn Certified Grass Fed status by A Greener World (AGW). Every animal is nurtured with mindful husbandry—grazing on organic hay and pasture grown right on the farm, without exposure to hormones, antibiotics, or GMOs. Their beef is USDA inspected and processed at Animal Welfare Approved facilities, ensuring complete transparency and ethical standards from pasture to plate. Customers can purchase meat by the cut or in bulk, and each product reflects the farm’s meticulous standards for health, flavor, and humane treatment.</p><p id="""">At Stuart Family Farm, the values run deep—care for the land, reverence for the animals, and gratitude for the loyal customers who support their vision of clean, local nourishment. Whether it’s the richness of their beef, the savory flavor of their pork, or the unmatched texture of their pastured poultry, every offering is a testament to the family’s dedication to doing things the right way. With glowing praise from chefs and families alike, the Stuarts continue to inspire trust, health, and connection through food grown with conscience.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68643412c288773359789520_IMG_0334-960x530.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6864341207f39ed5f6cd411a_chicken-2-960x530.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68643412c91b2d1f7e208c3a_pig-head-936x530.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686434124409a0c5341b8089_IMG_0383-960x530.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68643412b129019aa24e65b1_img_2947.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6864341211b8c8d84d0282e5_img_2949.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6864341248d4ed3d4b11c1bf_IMG_6851.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686434125f124850c332672e_IMG_2427.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68643413c91b2d1f7e208c7d_IMG_0447.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6864340ab0987bc7608eb525_img_4333.jpg,eatapeach874@gmail.com,(860) 355-0172 & (203) 788-0978,"191 Northrup Street, Bridgewater, CT 06752",https://www.stuartfamilyfarm.com/,Saturdays: 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM Sundays: 12:00 PM – 4:00 PM,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Meat (Beef – 100% Grass-Fed &amp; Grass-Finished):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Loin Strip Steak</li><li>T-Bone Steak</li><li>Porterhouse Steak</li><li>Rib Eye</li><li>London Broil</li><li>Sirloin</li><li>Tenderloin Steak</li><li>Flank Steak</li><li>Skirt Steak</li><li>Flat Iron</li><li>Hanging Tender Steak</li><li>Top Round Roast</li><li>Bottom Round Roast</li><li>Eye Round Roast</li><li>Chuck Roast</li><li>Rib (boneless)</li><li>Standing Rib (bone-in)</li><li>Shaved Sandwich Steak</li><li>Steak Kabobs</li><li>Ground Beef</li><li>Ground Beef Patties</li><li>Stew Meat</li><li>Soup/Shank Bones</li><li>Sliced Liver</li><li>Short Ribs</li><li>Brisket</li><li>Heart</li><li>Tongue</li><li>Kidney</li><li>Oxtail</li><li>Marrow and Knuckle Bones</li><li>Suet</li><li>Bulk Beef (customized quarters and sides)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Meat (Pastured Pork – Nitrate-Free Options Available):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Bacon</li><li>Bacon Ends</li><li>Halved Bone-In Ham Roast</li><li>Boneless Ham Roast</li><li>Ham Steak</li><li>Kielbasa</li><li>Bratwurst</li><li>Sausage</li><li>Bone-In Loin Chops</li><li>Boneless Loin Chops</li><li>Boston Butt</li><li>Smoked Hock</li><li>Country Style Spare Ribs</li><li>Rack of Ribs</li><li>Neck Bones</li><li>Soup Bones</li><li>Tenderloin</li><li>Ground Pork</li><li>Tongue</li><li>Trotter</li><li>Liver</li><li>Kidney</li><li>Tail</li><li>Ear</li><li>Leaf Lard</li><li>Bulk Pork (customized quarters and sides)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Poultry (Pastured Chicken – Freedom Rangers):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Whole Chicken</li><li>Drumsticks</li><li>Chicken Wings</li><li>Chicken Feet</li><li>Chicken Liver</li><li>Chicken Necks</li><li>Chicken Gizzards</li><li>Chicken Back Bones</li><li>Boneless, Skinless Breasts</li><li>Bone-in, Skin-on Thighs</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eggs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh Eggs – $8.00/dozen</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other Products:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Organically grown hay (used on farm)</li><li><em id="""">Rody’s Dry Rubs</em> (hand-blended, locally made seasoning blends available in store)</li><li>Local raw honey (seasonal)</li></ul><p>‍</p>",

The Maddox family has tended this land since the 1890s, and it has remained a constant in the local agricultural landscape for over a century. Originally a dairy operation known as Three Springs Farm, it evolved into Sun One Organic Farm in 1998 when Rob Maddox inherited the land and reimagined its purpose with a deep commitment to sustainable farming and environmental ethics.</p><p id="""">Rob Maddox brings a rare combination of political acumen, business expertise, and environmental passion to the farm. With an MBA from the University of Connecticut and years of service in local and state government, Rob pivoted toward green energy initiatives before returning to his roots in Litchfield County. That same devotion to ecological responsibility now guides every aspect of Sun One's operations. Under his stewardship, the farm employs no-till organic practices and works tirelessly to grow nutrient-dense produce that nourishes both people and the planet.</p><p id="""">But Sun One is more than just a farm—it’s a community space, creative haven, and deeply personal expression of place-based living. With Airbnbs including a thoughtfully restored silo and a tranquil geodesic dome, visitors are invited to step into a slower rhythm and connect with the land. The farm also hosts weddings, events, and immersive internships, offering others a chance to live and learn within its ecosystem. Every inch of Sun One is a testament to Rob’s vision: that authenticity, care for the earth, and the sharing of beauty are at the heart of a life well-lived.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e1b63e17a964f93b8_2571d3_86f5ea4eaf9b46ac84aefc2511156e9d~mv2_d_1536_2048_s_2.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e10d360f05a883b0e_sun-one-farm-venue-drone-ct-m3mediapro-3.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e6a5dafabb95e3cfb_2571d3_778312e0efac4a0ea8f1d900ace47cfa~mv2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e53076d6555f7f6b9_2571d3_f090db01d26244b0a9a2918b05fe5e8f~mv2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e4b5afbb6fa97fc70_2571d3_2fbd0a85167b4967ba1f2177cf75d58e~mv2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e54105547e3e88ee4_2571d3_4a19306cc5494e588e8d41cb596aebcd~mv2.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e9632b47871b385e7_2571d3_a20eabda09b1424dabe4b9d114f25b9e~mv2.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e87270569bd781290_2571d3_2b6eb0baad474595964078d999c1c5c2~mv2.avif; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e20681b4206e3dc2b_485166358_9532311086828215_5854650853960936970_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd42e6b21bddd7239914b_2571d3_8531b450c9dc4104b15c5d14232183d0~mv2.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd427c46e260a2e57daa9_2571d3_a88d7f3cfca0497087488723604f626a~mv2.avif,sunoneorganicfarm@gmail.com,(203) 266-7973,"50 Maddox Rd, Bethlehem, CT 06751",https://www.sunoneorganic.com/,,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Tomatoes</li><li>Potatoes</li><li>Salad Greens</li><li>Various other seasonal produce </li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh organic fruit</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Custom-grown flowers (for weddings and events)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>CSA produce shares</li><li>Farm-to-table ingredients for events</li></ul>",

Founded and lovingly run by the Case family, the farm’s heartbeat is its rich maple sugaring heritage, dating back more than 50 years. It all began with Arlow Case Jr., who as a young boy, learned the art of syrup making from his parents in a backyard sugarhouse affectionately called “Arlow’s Sugar Shack” in Granby, CT. Today, that tradition lives on through a modern sugarhouse built in 2005, where the family still boils sap harvested from a sprawling sugarbush spread across seven towns in two states.</p><p id="""">But Sweet Wind Farm is far more than a sugaring operation. Susan Case brings her love of plants, flowers, and education to the farm’s daily rhythm. From cultivating vibrant blooms and greenhouse treasures to creating specialty foods and leading classes, her imprint is felt in every corner of the land. Together, Arlow and Susan tend the soil, plant and harvest crops, sell at markets, and welcome the community to their sugarhouse and farmstand. From raspberries to rhubarb, zinnias to zucchini, everything is grown with deep care and without the use of chemical sprays or fertilizers.</p><p id="""">Sweet Wind Farm isn’t just a business—it’s a living embodiment of stewardship, family, and connection to the land. Whether you visit for maple syrup during sugaring season, wander through their colorful flower displays in summer, or browse homemade goods at their roadside stand, you’ll find more than just food. You’ll find history, warmth, and the quiet joy of a family farm doing things the right way.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a2cc75e24bfe412fff_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_853.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a2daf08e0f185b8449_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_960.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a255ff6da7f9f126a6_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_1707.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a253773d98812a9bbc_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_1707%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a288c7232450518120_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_960%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a2a9012bbbe49a56b1_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_1015.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a2870f2478d1dd95e4_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_1280.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a28bdb48594a38bd3a_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_1707%20(3).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a2e9f8fcb3415a4a5a_download%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a2a804e6cddf723db2_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_960%20(2).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a2de0a388c0c576ac1_rs%3Dw_600%2Ch_451%2Ccg_true.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a4e9f8fcb3415a4b5d_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_1707%20(2).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba3a67c5267c8b69c40bc_download.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba392ca0a0ddd3db47e70_484902599_1073724951466543_3000980767208061919_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba469bcb1b4951601dc8d_472491184_18473573863036936_8695504965263507246_n.jpg,sweetwindfarm@hotmail.com,(860) 653-2038,"339 South Road, East Hartland, CT 06027",https://sweetwindfarm.net/,"Open daily, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM (subject to seasonal variation)","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Tomatoes (multiple flavorful and rare varieties)</li><li>Squash</li><li>Cucumbers</li><li>Beans</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Ground cherries</li><li>Tomatillos</li><li>Pumpkins (Autumn)</li><li>Popcorn (Autumn)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Strawberries</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Raspberries</li><li>Apples</li><li>Rhubarb</li><li>Melons</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Herbs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Parsley</li><li>Sage</li><li>Basil</li><li>Chives</li><li>Cilantro</li><li>Dill</li><li>Mint</li><li>Dried herbs and herbal vinegars</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flowers &amp; Plants:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Cosmos, Zinnias, Dahlias, Sunflowers</li><li>Other cut flower varieties (July–October)</li><li>Garden plants (vegetable, flower, herb starts—May)</li><li>Houseplants</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Specialty Foods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Jams and jellies</li><li>Maple granola</li><li>Maple baked bean kits</li><li>Occasional baked goods</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Maple Products:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Maple syrup (various sizes and packaging)</li><li>Maple sugar candy</li><li>Granulated maple sugar</li><li>Maple cream</li><li>Maple jelly</li><li>Maple lollipops</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other Local Goods (Seasonal):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Raw honey</li><li>Potatoes</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Sweet corn</li></ul><p>‍</p>",

The farm's origins stretch back to 1898, when the Mattern family first settled on this land, driven by a belief in the value of hard work, stewardship, and community. Over the decades, the land evolved—from orchards to dairy cattle, from setbacks to rebirth—culminating in the founding of Sweet Grass Creamery, a small but mighty operation rooted in tradition and committed to excellence.</p><p id="""">Today, under the leadership of Ed Mattern and his partner Carol Wojtkun, Sweet Grass Creamery is a full-circle dairy, managing every step of the process: from raising healthy, happy Jersey cows on lush rotationally grazed pastures to handcrafting milk, yogurt, and cheeses directly on-site. The creamery’s philosophy is simple yet profound—treat the land and animals with respect, and in return, you’ll be given milk that is naturally rich, nutritious, and delicious. Their Creamline milk is minimally processed using low-temperature pasteurization and is never homogenized or separated, preserving its full flavor and integrity, just the way nature intended.</p><p id="""">What makes Sweet Grass Creamery especially remarkable is its dual dedication—to old-fashioned quality and modern sustainability. The farm uses no pesticides, antibiotics, or synthetic hormones, and partners with a vibrant community of local growers to offer not only their own artisan dairy but also fresh meats, eggs, produce, and pantry staples at their farm market. With every bottle of golden milk, every velvety spoonful of yogurt, and every wedge of handcrafted cheese, Sweet Grass Creamery invites you to savor a better, more beautiful way of eating—one deeply connected to land, animals, family, and the seasons.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68951f2e00bd35ed335dba4a_unnamed%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68951f402e62914d933c7669_527450571_1261449409358899_1781499184004594913_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68951f5e91f8000023dbd3da_487552364_1160832336087274_1434350924517775564_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68951f7747c65d96282ef612_487696163_1161115432725631_5259819362915106035_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68951f1f9c6e358a09cfd0f2_unnamed.webp,sweetgrasscreamery@gmail.com,(860) 887‑8098,"51 Mattern Rd, Preston, CT 06365",sweetgrass-creamery.com,Farm market daily 9 AM–6 PM,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Dairy</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Creamline Whole Milk (non-homogenized)</li><li>Creamline Maple Milk</li><li>Creamline Chocolate Milk</li><li>Creamline Coffee Milk</li><li>Sweet Jersey Cream (Eggnog – seasonal)</li><li>Plain Creamline Yogurt</li><li>Maple Yogurt</li><li id="""">Fruit on the Bottom Yogurt:<ul id=""""><li>Apple Pie</li><li>Blackberry</li><li>Blueberry</li><li>Peach Melba</li><li>Strawberry</li><li>Very Berry</li></ul></li><li>Labneh (yogurt cheese)</li><li>Cheese Curds</li><li>Whole Milk Ricotta</li><li>Mascarpone</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eggs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Local eggs (from partner farms; seasonal availability)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pantry/Other</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh baked goods (from partner farms)</li><li>Local honey</li><li>Local maple syrup</li><li>Local jams</li><li>Ice cream (local)</li><li>Freshly roasted coffee beans (local)</li><li>Produce (local, seasonal)</li><li>Meat (from partner farms; seasonal availability)</li></ul>",

Founded by the Duesing family—Kassie, Daniel, and their children Zoe, Charlotte, and Kingston—the farm began in 2020 with the leasing of Hawk Hill Farm through a partnership with Traprock Ridge Land Conservancy. Since then, the family has expanded operations to their own land on Duncaster Road and additional grazing pastures in Simsbury. United by a love for nature and a belief in soil health, The 4 Five Farm is a quiet force of integrity in modern farming.</p><p id="""">At its heart, the farm is built on a deep respect for the animals they raise and the community they feed. Specializing in pasture-raised poultry and eggs, organically-fed chicks, and sustainably raised lamb and pork, the Duesings provide high-quality nourishment while remaining committed to ethical stewardship. Their roadside egg stand is open 24/7 on the honor system, a simple testament to the trust they extend to their customers. Meanwhile, their chick operation—complete with a thoughtful Rooster Reassurance policy—reflects the farm’s personal attention to each life they nurture.</p><p id="""">With vegetables returning in 2025 and an eye toward continual growth, The 4 Five Farm is both a working farm and an ever-evolving family story. The land they lease and love is not just a place of production, but of learning, renewal, and connection. Whether you’re picking up chicks, placing a pork share order, or simply grabbing a dozen eggs from the porch stand, you’ll feel the warmth of a farm that grows more than food—it cultivates care, transparency, and a return to what's real.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865889c09258545cf28b397_rs%3Dw_400%2Ccg_true%2Cm.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865889c5fe2a9f8068ad6af_rs%3Dw_400%2Ccg_true.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865889c306665cdf8f4bdda_rs%3Dw_400%2Ccg_true%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865889cefe13911ae13f882_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_960.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865889c306665cdf8f4be5a_101072061_151236679872716_7272795472392093696_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865889c5b4de40610fe46e8_485769904_968305268810065_1893083879626560621_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/6865889743b04e3f13a3ef0a_484191942_963867219253870_2975643542898100624_n.jpg,daniel@the4fivefarm.com,(203) 231-1553,"208 Duncaster Road, Bloomfield, CT 06002",https://the4fivefarm.com/,Roadside Stand Open 24/7,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Poultry &amp; Livestock:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Pasture-raised whole chickens <em id="""">(processed in USDA facility; seasonal)</em></li><li>Whole &amp; half lamb shares <em id="""">(email for availability)</em></li><li>Whole &amp; half pork shares <em id="""">(email for availability)</em></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Chicks (Pullets):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Red Sex Link – $40</li><li>Blue Andalusian – $15</li><li>Silver Laced Wyandotte – $13</li><li>Easter Egger – $10 (preorder)</li><li>Barred Rock – $10 (preorder)</li><li>Rhode Island Red – $10 (preorder)</li><li>Novogen White – $10 (preorder)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Feeds &amp; Supplies:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Stone House Grain Organic Chick Starter:<ul id=""""><li>10 lb – $12</li><li>25 lb – $25</li><li>50 lb – $40</li></ul></li><li>Stone House Organic Grower &amp; Layer Feed – $40 (50 lb)</li><li>Pine shavings – $12/bag</li><li>Large feeder – $15</li><li>Metal waterer for mason jar – $5</li><li>Metal feeder for mason jar – $7</li><li>Mason jars – $2/each</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables (Seasonal):</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Kale</li><li>Tatsoi</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Beets</li><li>Onions</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Eggplant</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Other:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Fresh-cut flowers</li><li>Educational content on poultry raising</li></ul>",

Founded in 1988, The Farm has grown steadily, guided by a family deeply rooted in agriculture. The property spans approximately 180 lush acres, where fields of vegetables and flowers flourish alongside greenhouses teeming with carefully tended plants and transplants. Emphasizing a holistic, integrated approach, The Farm practices soil conservation, composting, and Integrated Pest Management to maintain environmental balance.</p><p id="""">The farm’s dedicated stewardship is led by a passionate family team, now into its second generation of growers. Initially dairy farmers in Newtown, Connecticut, the family faced the pressures of rising land values in the 1980s and adapted by moving operations to Woodbury, continuing their farming tradition. Over decades, they've expanded carefully—not to become the largest farm, but rather to remain sustainable and secure for their growing families and community. Beyond vegetables, The Farm nurtures honeybees and operates a thriving sugarbush for maple syrup production under the Woodbury Sugar Shed brand, originating as a modest backyard hobby in 1982 and now producing hundreds of gallons of high-quality maple syrup annually.</p><p id="""">Deeply connected to their local community, The Farm actively supports local educational programs, charities, and town initiatives.

The land, farmed by the Hein family for over 200 years, found new life in 2020 when Jennifer Villa officially took the reins. A lifelong Connecticut resident and landscape designer by trade, Jennifer had long been passionate about plants, classic farm trucks, and locally grown food. In 2017, she launched Farmington Farm Truck—a mobile farmers market born of these loves—and by 2020, it blossomed into a full-fledged farm and permanent stand at 303 Meadow Road.</p><p id="""">Today, Jennifer stewards 22 acres of farmland, actively growing on five, with a deep commitment to organic practices and soil health. Her vision includes a robust garden center, cut-your-own flower gardens, and a bustling farm stand filled with fresh produce—both homegrown and sourced from other Connecticut farms. The farm is also home to a flock of free-ranging, bell-wearing “jingle chickens,” who delight visitors young and old. Whether you're picking up heirloom tomatoes, cutting flowers in bloom, or enjoying a CSA share of local abundance, the farm is designed to reconnect people with the joys of real food and seasonal living.</p><p id="""">Beyond growing food, The Farm Truck at Hein Farm cultivates community. Signature events like the Chickenstock Music Festival and Firefly Fridays draw crowds with live music, food trucks, hayrides, and more. Jennifer also honors the land’s legacy by supporting local nonprofits, youth programs, and creating the annual David and Martha Hein Agriculture Scholarship, awarded to Farmington High students pursuing agricultural paths. The farm is not only a place to shop or stroll—it’s a hub of education, celebration, and enduring stewardship, deeply rooted in the belief that local is not just better—it’s essential.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685068d655b1631b51c148e2_rs%3Dw_600%2Ch_300%2Ccg_true.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685068d41be84582a2d15195_rs%3Dw_600%2Ch_300%2Ccg_true%20(1).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685068d4b0ecaa8326ddaca8_rs%3Dw_600%2Ch_300%2Ccg_true%20(2).webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685068d45a8df988cec4711c_download.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685068d4ed194d5991ea485f_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_961.webp; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506936d7b5be8f786143af_504435511_18351539065155936_7245667068552580418_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506936a12c714c0c4ca8be_495020191_1807336630034898_4488625374159181097_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68506936347e5b2484a37549_469111793_18329728183155936_6700274976147836601_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/685068cebb499962f26445d8_rs%3Dw_1280%2Ch_1084.webp,grow@farmingtonfarmtruck.farm,(860) 952-2767,"303 Meadow Road, Farmington, CT 06032",https://farmingtonfarmtruck.farm/,Varies by season.

As the farm expanded into Terryville and began attending weekly farmers markets, it became a full-fledged family affair, with siblings and children pitching in. The late Paul Tonn, known for his tireless work ethic and deep love of farming, was instrumental in keeping the operation alive through challenging times. Today, his legacy is lovingly carried forward by Jordan and Aubri Tonn, along with their daughter Sienna, who warmly welcomes guests as they arrive at the bustling Marketplace.</p><p id="""">Tonn’s Marketplace is more than just a farm—it’s a destination.

Originally a dairy farm, it was purchased in 1942 by A. Richard and Dorothy Diebold using a “lock, stock, and barrel” contract—acquiring everything from the land and livestock to the very furniture in the farmhouse. Over the years, the Diebold family cultivated a diverse array of crops and livestock, building a life deeply rooted in the rhythms of the land. Today, that same spirit endures in every corner of the farm, from the grazing cattle to the lovingly preserved antique equipment.</p><p id="""">Now specializing in pasture-raised beef, pork, chicken, and eggs, Toplands Farm is committed to responsible, transparent agriculture. Their beef cattle graze freely across open pastures, supplemented with farm-grown hay and a modest amount of grain for optimal flavor and tenderness. Their Berkshire pigs, known for their depth of flavor and exquisite marbling, are raised with care and fed a mix of garden vegetables and natural grains. Even the chickens are thoughtfully housed in mobile coops and are part of a rotational grazing system that reflects the farm’s deep respect for both animals and land.</p><p id="""">But Toplands Farm offers more than food—it is also home to the Double D Living History Farm, which maintains the largest collection of restored antique tractors and farm equipment in the Northeast. Founded by Dudley G. Diebold, who began collecting as a boy, the museum showcases over 300 machines, an operating sawmill, and countless historical artifacts, all lovingly preserved on-site. Through its living history displays, pasture-raised meats, and longstanding family legacy, Toplands Farm continues to nourish both body and spirit while honoring the agricultural traditions that shaped this corner of New England.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e109e3deeafa4622fa_464984356_18345487615135883_5010358752144247183_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e2dd70955a9908f48f_470201418_18351661438135883_1205226931910854974_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e18bb5c5b43044b918_480505332_1202877385174377_1774317315513123038_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e17339dde89333ce3f_494184883_1264682938993821_698770675983190632_n.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e2eaa186e6bc75748a_Nikki%2BHine%2BToplands%2BFarm%2BLLC%2B-%2BIMG_5365.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e16484817fc9285868_Nikki%2BHine%2BToplands%2BFarm%2BLLC%2B-%2BIMG_0351.jpeg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e1ec8516e88d50d5c4_Nikki%2BHine%2BToplands%2BFarm%2BLLC%2B-%2BIMG_9898.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6e1c7e82c1afb80dde8_Nikki%2BHine%2BToplands%2BFarm%2BLLC%2B-%2BIMG_2520.jpeg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/686bd6dcccac8cca1ce3663c_470669265_18352045285135883_2860129145025898957_n.jpg,,(860) 354-0649,"102 Painter Hill Road, Roxbury, CT 06783",https://www.toplandsfarm.com/,Meat Shop open 1PM - 4PM or shop online through website,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Meat</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Beef (pasture-raised, hormone-free)</li><li>Pork (Berkshire pigs – known for marbling, tenderness, and flavor)</li><li>Chicken (whole roasting chickens, pasture-raised in small batches)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eggs</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Farm-fresh eggs from mobile coops (barn-kept in winter)</li></ul>",

Originally known simply as the farm of its cultivator—as was common in early New England—it became known as Tulmeadow in the early 20th century, named after a meadow north of the cow barn and in homage to the family name. Over the centuries, the farm has evolved through many forms of production, from dairy cows and chickens to tobacco and Christmas trees, always adapting while remaining grounded in tradition.</p><p id="""">In recent decades, Tulmeadow has embraced a direct-to-consumer model that reflects both old-world simplicity and modern sustainability. The bustling farm store sells everything from freshly harvested vegetables and pasture-raised meats to locally made jams, cheeses, and baked goods. Its greenhouse operations extend the growing season, and the beloved ice cream—made in-house since 1994—has become a regional icon. From field to freezer, every pint is crafted with care, earning Tulmeadow accolades and a loyal following.</p><p id="""">Yet, beyond its wide array of offerings, Tulmeadow is a story of preservation and care. The Tullers work in partnership with the Simsbury Land Trust to ensure that this historic farmland and its surrounding forests remain protected for generations to come. With careful stewardship of the land, low-chemical growing practices, and a genuine passion for community, Tulmeadow Farm remains a living legacy—where the past is honored, the present is full of flavor, and the future is rooted in integrity.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba6870111645bd18e7130_hompage_mural.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba687e15597812711aaf6_garden1.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba687a9012bbbe49ba3ee_fields_north.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba68778bfb921948c1c5d_fields_mowing_grass.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba6877b73298868027f6c_garden21.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba6877c5267c8b69d7276_fields_woods.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba687cb9ea083f22e7b2c_fields_cows_grazing2.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba6877a9689e97d5fa6f0_488970592_9732797273409657_6876346596078947785_n.jpg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/683ba6897c5267c8b69d7301_492152362_1085767666918725_1291268712756372397_n.jpg,don@tulmeadowfarmstore.com,(860) 658-1430,"255 Farms Village Road, Box 100, West Simsbury, CT 06092-2437",https://www.tulmeadowfarmstore.com/,"Open daily, 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM","<p id=""""><strong id="""">Meat:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Hormone-free, grass-fed beef (steaks, ground beef, patties, hot dogs, kelly dogs, kielbasa)</li><li>Pork</li><li>Chicken</li><li>Turkey</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Vegetables:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Lettuce (baby lettuce, mesclun mix, arugula)</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Swiss chard</li><li>Tatsoi</li><li>Tomatoes (heirloom, grape, cherry, sauce, standard)</li><li>Cucumbers</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Scallions</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Bok choy</li><li>Squash</li><li>Zucchini</li><li>Green beans</li><li>Eggplant</li><li>Pumpkins</li><li>Gourds</li><li>Brussel sprouts</li><li>Winter squash</li><li>Garlic scapes</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Onions</li><li>Potatoes</li><li>Shallots</li><li>Kale</li><li>Yellow beans</li><li>Soybeans</li><li>Asparagus</li><li>Rhubarb</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Apples (including Macoun)</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Blueberries</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Plums</li><li>Nectarines</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Dairy &amp; Eggs:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Milk (including buttermilk, almond, oat, and soy milk)</li><li>Butter</li><li>Cream</li><li>Eggs</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Frozen &amp; Prepared Foods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Chicken pot pies</li><li>Frozen pies (Chef Pierre ‘Hi’ line)</li><li>Ice cream pies</li><li>Ice cream sandwiches</li><li>Ice cream bars (on-a-stick)</li><li>Ice cream (pints and quarts, made onsite)</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Specialty Foods &amp; Pantry Items:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Local honey</li><li>Local maple syrup</li><li>Jams, jellies, spreads, condiments</li><li>Pasta, breads, dough</li><li>Salsa</li><li>Chips</li><li>Pesto</li><li>Tomato sauce</li><li>Bruschetta</li><li>Cocoa</li><li>Grafton cheese</li><li>Goat cheese</li><li>Fudge</li><li>Pickled vegetables (jarred, including PA Dutch varieties)</li><li>Canning jar specialty nuts</li><li>Old-fashioned candies</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Plants &amp; Seasonal Goods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Bedding plants</li><li>Perennials</li><li>Pumpkins and gourds (seasonal)</li><li>Corn stalks (seasonal)</li><li>Fresh-cut Christmas trees</li><li>Wreaths and handmade swags</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Gifts &amp; Other Local Goods:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Pottery</li><li>Ghanaian Bogo baskets</li><li>Handmade gifts (cutting boards, bibs, aprons, cards, games, etc.)</li><li>Wild Republic stuffed animals and puzzles</li></ul>",

Born from humble beginnings as a dairy operation in 1919, the farm was cultivated by E.J. and Bess Wade with steady hands and uncompromising values. What began as a small roadside fruit stand grew into a larger farm store by 1969—a space that continues to flourish today under the stewardship of E.J. and Bess’s son and grandchildren.</p><p id="""">The Wade family has long believed in one simple philosophy, passed down through the generations: “I don’t try to sell anything in my stand that I wouldn’t want to eat myself.” That sentiment, once quoted by E.J. Wade in a 1950 Hartford Times interview, still rings true every time a customer walks through the doors. Wade’s shelves are stocked with only the freshest produce, local honey, jams, baked goods, and pantry staples—all carefully selected and sorted by hand. Their motto of top quality and community care has endured for over a century.</p><p id="""">Wade’s is more than a place to shop; it is a living history. From black-and-white photographs of the original stand to generations of Bloomfield families stopping in for fresh pies or summer fennel, it remains a beacon of consistency and charm in a changing world. The recent passing of Ronald F. Wade at the age of 91 marked not just the end of a remarkable life, but the continuation of a legacy rooted in integrity, nourishment, and hometown pride.</p>",,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68658f4e0e66f0256e5f376c_AT-65309.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68658f4fe2c18f52711ec307_thebanjoguys.jpg; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68658f4e96d06006491bcd53_image1002%2B(1).jpeg,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/682e61294a138bb1442a7444/68658f4cc1ca17f83ac31d03_wades%2Bsign.png,wadesfarm@yahoo.com,(860) 243-1855,"498 Simsbury Road, Bloomfield, CT 06002",https://www.wadesfarm.com/,Monday – Friday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM Saturday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM Sunday: 9:00 AM – 3:00 PM,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Fruit:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li>Bananas</li><li>Citrus</li><li>Melons</li><li>Cal.

Waldingfield's extensive produce list, ranging from leafy greens and root vegetables to succulent summer squashes and colorful tomatoes, is complemented by artisanal food products crafted to elevate the farm-to-table experience. Their community-supported agriculture (CSA) program, active farm stand, and consistent presence at local farmers' markets underscore their dedication to bridging the gap between the farm and local communities.</p><p id="""">Owned and operated by brothers Patrick and Quincy Horan, Waldingfield Farm is a vibrant reflection of their passion for organic agriculture, community engagement, and environmental stewardship.

With farms in Dutch Harbor (Jamestown) and Point Judith Pond (Narragansett), the company takes pride in producing two signature oyster varieties: the briny, beginner-friendly “Dutchies,” and the complex, sweet “Rocky Rhodes.” A third offering, “Thomas Points,” comes from a sister farm operated by their farm manager, grown over nutrient-rich underwater springs for a unique flavor profile.</p><p id="""">Now owned by Brad Boehringer, the company blends hard science with sustainability and a lean farming philosophy—minimizing waste and constantly improving processes to benefit both the environment and product quality. Oyster farming plays a vital ecological role, filtering water, reducing nitrogen, and creating marine habitats. Their floating bag culture method ensures strong, shuckable shells and consistent quality.</p><p id="""">Walrus and Carpenter Oysters prides itself on direct, same-day delivery to chefs, emphasizing freshness and dependability no matter the conditions. In addition to its wholesale program, the farm has launched local online ordering with weekly pickups and is expanding educational outreach through tours and community events.

Allen, a lifelong farmer with over four decades of experience, is renowned for his mastery of pasture management, while Robin lends a warm, artistic touch to the farm’s daily rhythms and public presence.</p><p id="""">The Cockerlines raise their animals with uncommon devotion and skill. Their cattle—crossbred from Angus, Devon, and New Zealand stock—graze rotationally, responding to Allen’s familiar call as they move through verdant pastures. The livestock are never given grain, hormones, or antibiotics. Pork and poultry are raised with the same attention to welfare, and all meat is dry-aged, vacuum-sealed, and frozen at peak freshness. Their store, open Fridays and Saturdays, is always stocked with a rotating selection of cuts, eggs, honey, and maple syrup—each reflecting the season and their meticulous care.</p><p id="""">Beyond their products, Whippoorwill Farm has cultivated a deep relationship with the land and the surrounding community. Allen and Robin’s story—shaped by chance meetings, art school dreams, and the draw of the land—embodies the enduring spirit of small-scale, intentional farming.
